mr presidentinoffice you mentioned the extent to which action by rebel forces in ndjamena had delayed the mission but some mention must also be made of the lack of means at the disposal of the european union to deal with this kind of mission particularly concerning logistics and helicopters
apart from this reservation maintaining a margin of eur 23 billion below the financial perspectives could be justified
it also of course means that other countries around the world may go further than the protocol requires
that can be solved in effect through structural reforms and also of course through public finances that have been straightened out by means of political willpower to contain public spending to the point where it becomes sustainable so that european citizens can pay reasonable modern taxes

to our parliamentary counterparts from the east from central and southern europe who took part for the first time i have this to say not only did you follow the work that was done but you gave something to the convention

it is because of the cfp that we can put forward proposed common solutions as we are doing now instead of witnessing individual member states joining in a race downhill in the direction of the total destruction of fishing
in october 2005 the catastrophic earthquake opened the eyes of the world to the desperate plight of the kashmiri people
i am afraid that todays reports will come to nothing as long as national governments behave in the same sort of populistic and hypocritical way as this parliament rather than confronting difficult truths and taking uncomfortable measures for survival
presidentinoffice of the council i realise the difficulties regarding irelands situation because it is an island and because of its dependence as regards transport
the commission is proposing approximately eur 1 billion for the development of food aid and production in developing countries
therefore my question is will these problems which are affecting austria and germany be recognised and are appropriate solutions being planned
now it wants more money to spend on yet another ambitious and seriously misguided project
across europe and the world it behoves us all to stand resolutely against it and its despicable apologists
no
we want to get to the bottom of the situation
migration can also cause challenges for the countries migrants leave behind
for our own part we will keep an eye on the further progress of the crisis and play our part by encouraging those in positions of responsibility in ukraine to see longterm political compromise in the interests of their country

i would like to add that the group of the european peoples party christian democrats and european democrats have long been aware of the importance of a dialogue of this nature and have therefore organised such dialogues for a number of years we also believe that with new challenges at a european and global level this dialogue is becoming even more important
in the light of the upcoming elections in 2009 we must ensure that free and fair elections take place and that a free and fair result will be respected by all sides
firstly its enthusiastic welcome for the reform treaty lisbon treaty is not one i can share in
with regard to louis grech i want to say that his levels of cooperation were excellent and that we finally agreed on all the main budget lines

modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century debate
on behalf of the alde group hu first of all i would like to clarify the following the background to my remarks is not the desire to question the right to free movement by europeans and hence of the roma nor do we or i wish to request any extra rights for these people for this minority group
i have received from the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left a request to include a statement by the commission on the situation of the alstom group after the general budget debate

the other reason is that nonremunerated donation provides blood which is safest and of the highest quality
now prisoners sentenced under the antiterrorist law are to be allowed to take part in cultural and sporting activities
the posted workers directive should protect workers who have been posted securing for them the appropriate rights while preventing social dumping protecting them from exploitation and saving them from being forced into accepting unreasonable social standards and thereby competing unfairly against workers in the host country
the oil tankers we do not want here any more must not end up on the beaches of the far east in large numbers
their bargaining power on the question not only of the final price but also of the preservation of the qualitative and nutritional elements in the final product lags behind the role which they should have

mr president the next round of world trade talks begins in mexico next week
we must therefore pay more attention to the evolution of debt in addition to tight control of the evolution of public deficit
however the labour force coming from those countries that have been slow to develop is for the most part illequipped for the jobs that our economies need doing
we heard mrs lo curto speak a moment ago
in the same way the other challenges that you raised including the economic governance of the euro area in response to the explosion of global prices of raw materials and hydrocarbons or the creation of an area of stability and prosperity in the mediterranean basin are entirely representative of your commitment to a european union that is more reactive to problems and more attentive to its population
mr president first of all i should like to express warm thanks to the rapporteur mrsdoyle who has given the initial impetus in several important areas in order to keep the environmental quality of these proposals intact
everybody must be in a position to use that information for themselves in a responsible manner
the possibility of medical risks being concealed is always a factor when large amounts of money are involved and this presents dangers not only for the donor but also for the recipient
in these circumstances in particular it was surprising and positive that the member states were actually able to issue a joint forwardlooking declaration on iraq in which the european union also exhibits a sense of responsibility by promising both humanitarian aid and implicit help in reconstructing the country
how is this contradiction to be resolved between this pressure to reduce costs and the demands for quality
i should like to recall that competition policy as it is currently legislated for and regulated by the european union can by no means meet the needs of these regions which do not have as many opportunities as others
our group has tabled a motion for a resolution which is currently being discussed with the other groups
the commissions actions are evidently worse for the eu with propaganda than without it in terms of legitimacy
in this question we have also floated the idea of establishing a reserve compensation fund but this must not be seen as a demand on our part or by the commission
in order to promote this publicprivate water supply mix the group of the european peoples party has tabled various amendments to the annual report on the commission communication on water management in developing countries and i would ask all members of this house to support them
if they are not then this is not really tolerable
the old regulation is out of date and the european union needs to demonstrate its solidarity in the areas affected especially when we are talking about major disasters because that is how it gets closer to its citizens
could the commission and also the council say a little more about how the funds will be spent particularly where this minority and other small minorities are concerned
if we ignore this fact there is a missing link in our approach to refugees as professor gil loescher who survived the baghdad blast and is with us here today has rightly pointed out
the current wording in the directive is very confusing and can i believe lead to legal uncertainty
full and indepth information for the donor from a trained person on the purpose nature consequences and risks involved in the donation is a necessary precondition to free consent
she asked about the legal basis of this regulation
it was conducted under the firstpastthepost voting system which is inherently unfair and is no longer defensible in the 21st century
it follows that the simplification of directives should be no more than a secondary objective
i also believe it is important to point to the serious consequences for beekeeping operations of the virus as a result of which over 50 of the european beekeeping sector has been destroyed
therefore whatever the fine rhetoric that might flow from this house the true aim of this particular european year is to promote further european integration
however i would also like to stress the social aspect of this legislation as regards the rights of disabled people especially blind or partially sighted people and their right to avail of free postal services
in this context i agree with several of the critical observations contained in the osce report for example that the political parties have had unequal access to television coverage
the requirements for nonhazardous or inert waste should remain proportional and not as proposed by the committee be largely subjected to the same stringency as category a hazardouswaste sites
every attempt to achieve real autonomy is after all regarded as a crime giving rise to legal proceedings and the concept of political offences is unknown in china

it is about less risk more safety
agreements of this kind which have been signed with various countries are of major importance in the fight against illegal immigration
even when certain programmes present it amongst their objectives the results are not analysed and we know that this objective of equality is not really being met
i wish to add my gratitude to that expressed by members of this house to the rapporteur mr leinen to the greek presidency of the council and also to the commission for enabling an acceptable compromise to be worked out yesterday
serious economic damage as a result of excessive rainfall in one half of europe and serious economic damage resulting from the terrible drought suffered by the other half of europe a drought that feeds the forest fires particularly in portugal france and spain which have cost the lives of dozens of people including firefighters and pilots involved in fighting those fires
this right must be effectively protected
i would say that strangely europe does not need economic assistance so much as credibility and specific legislation which will allow it to launch its initiatives for the future
i am convinced however that the present programme has the potential to contribute a great deal towards reducing euroscepticism
if we regard the protection of the environment and public health as things to be aimed at then what is needed is not just a programme costing eur400million but rather the sort of focused determination that intervenes and says clearly that transport cannot simply be allowed to trundle along as it is doing but must be guided which it now is being albeit in the wrong direction
there are therefore now better conditions for europe to give a fresh impulse to relations with mercosur and to the doha negotiations
a further meeting with the competent italian authorities is due to take place in the next few days
there is however a necessity and an urgency for the state to be involved in the protection of workers and the social protection aspects
this is very important because it means that ships will not be able to call at locations where they know they will be able to avoid inspections
mr president ladies and gentlemen repeated accidents and an increase in the transport of dangerous goods by sea constantly raise acute issues regarding strengthening the safety rules governing all maritime straits in the european union and the resources needed in order to enforce these rules
it is also worth remembering that a significant proportion of the second sum will end up in the richer countries in the form of order and of payments to advisers and experts
today macedonia has returned to peace and we are more determined than ever to make up for lost time
if one talks of the lisbon strategy one must also refer to the commissions white paper on financial services policy 20052010 which relies on the integration of the european financial services market into the global financial services market and on the corresponding articles of the treaties of nice and lisbon which on the one hand prohibit any form of restriction on the free flow of capital and on the other hand are pushing the financial institutions into putting an unobstructed flow of financial services in place
the internet is not only a special kind of window on the world and a tool for exchanging views and gaining knowledge but it is also a means for facilitating many administrative matters
data on industrys expenditure on the protection of the environment are an important tool for policymakers in assessing the cost of adherence to environmental law including its effect on businesses competitiveness and checking whether the polluterpays principle is being adhered to
ro the compromise reached for the third maritime package will improve passenger safety as well as help protect the environment and reinforce control systems
i would like to add that the reason why i took so much trouble in overcoming the automatic rigid code of the 35hour week in france was precisely in the name of european harmonisation because no other country had followed you along that path
ties with russia where antieuropean moods are spreading and where some of the gains of democracy are being removed are becoming stronger and this has a certain influence on minsk
finally the commission considers that shortterm targeted measures taken to alleviate the impact of higher energy prices on poorer sections of the population might be justified
it also gives a purpose to cultural tourism
this is the only way to create new jobs
at the end of the amendment after open the corresponding process should be added the words including the possibility of membership
in spite of what some minority voices say mr schmid was not more preoccupied with industrial espionage than with individual monitoring
the political balance in congress has changed and right now the door may be open for the cooperation that must take place if change is to take place
we the unions institutions must at all times show that we cherish fundamental rights not only in words but in actions and above all in our own legislative action
it is clear that we must demonstrate flexibility and show ourselves to be capable of adapting to change
in this respect then commissioner patten is right the iraqi people have the right to live in peace without saddam hussein
if we do not support them financially and politically today if we do not give them the chance to develop then russia will do this quickly because these countries have extremely important and strategic significance for russia
finally i would like to raise the issue which was also dealt with by my colleague mr radwan of us convergence and global consequences
these include the sluggish economy and the increasing differences between the levels of development in the countries of the old and the new union
the commission is aware of the existence of social tension in italy
every country and region has its jewels and cultural heritage which it must protect as much as possible against earthquakes
i have three messages for the commission at wto level
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen on behalf of the presidency i should like to thank all of the speakers who have taken the floor
the matter at hand is the adaptation of information technology in the field of customs and excise
that however mr president is simply a matter of tidying up loose ends
it is therefore up to the commission to decide where the observation and information centre and the other services necessary for the implementation of the mechanism will be located
john hume the nobel peace prize laureate also attended our group meeting today and he stressed how important it had always been for him to perceive and acknowledge the differences in this europe of ours not just the differences between two sides but differences on the same side
to this end environmental impact assessment and strategic environmental assessment should be used when developing activities plans and programmes as they are much more appropriate instruments
one of the benefits of dictatorship of course is often that the lid is kept on social religious and racial tensions
mr president i just wish to clarify a couple of points
the points scored at first reading in parliament by the opponents of the original text are undeniable
in addition it is hard to think of many other modern european initiatives in the field of culture which have constituted a standard
de mr president i voted in favour of the report because it was made clear in parliament that it will remain a matter for member states to decide which and how many labour migrants will be accepted into their sovereign territory
as the commissioner has repeatedly observed he has obviously studied the original document with great care and this has enabled him to add even greater precision to certain items in the commission proposal which is in any case essentially a good one
i want to comment too on commissioner pattens very welcome statement that he did not see any connection between being european and antiamericanism
i must say though that in the years ahead we will have to carry out a thorough assessment of the effectiveness of this financial regulation in order to gauge the extent to which the rules contained therein may or may not be excessive and whether or not they are the cause of the abnormally large number of material errors detected every year by the court of auditors
looking at the implementation of the 2008 budget for example for palestine alone and the number of amending letters i can already tell that we are going to end up in a similar situation in 2009
i also support limits on exports to protect stocks which i am sure the wto will support and financial help from the eu to ensure rivers remain open for the passage of elvers
however intensive discussion has not been confined to this house
frankly this is not good enough
the third priority should be the fostering of fiscal discipline based on the best practices of the member states
on this basis the commissions ideas expressed in the communication deal with both the coordination of economic policies and the coordination and surveillance of budgetary policies
i am sorry but your speaking time is 30 seconds and the question is about human rights in cuba
this was also true of the fact that the council was asked about actions that it intends to pursue aimed at defining a joint member state approach and if possible a coordinated timetable for ratifying the constitution for europe and of preparing a communication strategy with the aim of achieving positive results in the ratification processes
now where is the constituent power
on 13 february 2004 75 nautical miles from the bosporus the ship hera sank with its entire crew of 19 on board in circumstances which are still unexplained
we therefore believe that the best course is to inspire national decisions rather than try to put forward proposals to be decided upon at european level
nonetheless the reasons behind certain estimates require clarification for example 53 for culture and the audiovisual sector below average rates of 18 in the area of social dimension and employment and 145 in the area of the labour market and technological innovation
we have made arrangements to have a video produced which will be distributed from 29october together with information panels intended for all our intermediaries and networks as well as for the national and regional public services that will be using them
member of the commission fr i have already answered that question
the commission is acting outside the sector
today we must say a big thank you to all of them
those of us who have studied the matter closely are certainly able to welcome the real progress that is nevertheless being made by turkey to reform its prison system
i voted for this resolution criticising the deteriorating situation of the press in europe especially in italy and which thereby demanded legislation on media mergers
it is therefore somewhat through the lack of an alternative and by default that we shall vote for this budget because europe the citizens cannot do without its interventions however inadequate
we need to have the courage to say this to our fellow citizens
in writing de europe has become more of a target for terrorists because it has allowed itself to be reduced to the role of an accomplice in the breaches of international law and human rights committed in the name of us foreign policy and also because it has not managed to act as an honest broker on the palestinian question
the same holds for amendment 13 tabled by the draftsman astrid lulling on behalf of the committee on womens rights and gender equality
in fact that is not the most crucial issue at stake
the debate is closed
what does this mean
another objection to the concept of nutrient profiles is the disproportionate administrative burden that this entails for the small and mediumsized enterprises which are indeed strongly represented in the foodstuffs industry
the member states need to adopt measures aimed at reconciling social professional and family life in line with the conclusions of the barcelona european council and of the lisbon strategy
in the 1940s my friends and i found some mercury and were pleased when the coins we dipped in it became a silvery colour
it might just as well be called rumpelstiltskin the important thing for us is what it does
our thanks therefore to rapporteur mr silva peneda and the majority in the committee on employment and social affairs
vicepresident of the commission i recently visited a country outside the european union where smoking is not prohibited and i really noticed how big a difference there is in the european union where you cannot smell the odour of cigarettes in public places at least
as is made clear in one of the recitals industry has an important part to play in this
i think that the eurobarometer shows clearly that european citizens are in favour of developing nanotechnologies
these other substances could be the subject of a subsequent proposal of the commission when risk assessments have been completed and the availability of safe substitutes analysed
the us agencies have admitted for example that they eavesdrop on european companies bidding for major foreign contracts allegedly because these companies engage in bribery
parliament has declared itself to be in favour of seeking a definitive solution for this sector within the framework of the com in fruit and vegetables
in this area we do see the solid outlines of a possible accommodation between the concerns of those who like yourselves are more ambitious where the environment is concerned and those who are more ambitious when it comes to competitiveness the two sets of concerns are not mutually exclusive
let us look at the facts of the matter at what we are proposing in our report
on this occasion i would like to stress my appreciation for the excellent collaboration between our institutions which is thanks to a new and successful approach promoted by the general rapporteur mrs haug
i always thought that if a political process in the united states was controlled by the white house all it took was the touch of a button and the entire administration and the executive did what the president wanted
we are to achieve it in two mandatory stages
the impression has been given in many quarters that we the existing european union of 25 states are the ones from whom they have to learn
in addition it is crucial to explore novel ideas such as mrs merkels proposal on calculating per capita emissions and to think about adjustments affecting in particular continents like africa which pollute less and are much harder hit by climate change
so the question now is this is it legally possible given the current state of the treaties and the caselaw of the court to allow the member states to exercise one of the communitys exclusive competences and if so under what conditions
a rapid agreement is possible
the aim of this proposal is to create a uniform portfolio of documents that will enable citizens applying for a job or a course of study to set out their personal qualifications in a manner that is comparable throughout the eu
it is important that the channels of communications between all interested parties are opened and indeed kept open
concerning the warning labels on alcoholic drinks which i know has been an issue of great debate both when the communication was being drafted and in parliament as well we will study the experience obtained by member states which are already in the process of introducing them and we will explore the possibility in cooperation with the member states of developing official common approaches throughout the community regarding this issue
in places the directive is also irrational and it will create more red tape
clearly the member in question is unaware of how things really are and i would therefore ask that his comment be removed from the minutes or that the european parliament considers in this house the consequences of such a serious statement which i do not feel should have been made in this chamber
on the principle there is no more to say the passport is its own defence however it is necessary to ensure that the introduction of the passport for management companies is accompanied by the necessary guarantees especially as regards the supervision of funds as it leads to dissociation of functions beyond borders
we who are members of the convention or members of the european parliament must turn to our national governments and within the convention we must fight to ensure that the future european constitution genuinely contains legal provisions providing a framework for competition law
i would like to emphasise that point too in the midterm review
there are four matters to which i would like to draw your attention
iraq presents us with a challenge
during these times of crisis it is important for us to defend the values on which our union is based and to protect the weak members of our society
it is a systemsoriented measure that i call on the european union to promote in support of the actions taken by member states
at the same time the european union needs to give a clear signal that it stands ready to honour its commitments that is crucial in order to keep up the momentum
the system exists and it is at the disposal of the member states but it is not the commission s responsibility
political opponents of the regime are being neutralised
i do not deny that there is an important crossborder dimension to this kind of criminal activity
there is enlargement of course but as in 1990 it is still german
i thank the commissioner and would like to take this opportunity to wish her all the best in her work as part of the commission
given the circumstances i believe it appropriate to do so and i am therefore going to ask plenary to give its opinion on the proposal of the group of the greenseuropean free alliance
there are still those sceptics who hesitate and doubt whether we really need a timetable and whether we really need to present the citizens with a renewed basis in 2009 as we in the berlin declaration said that we would
mr president european consumers are groaning under the weight of high food prices and i think one of the causes of the exorbitant price increases is the concentration in the retail market on a few big players
in effect whenever we talk about developing new telecommunications networks we cannot come to a deadlock on this essential objective
could we really not have taken a different attitude to prevent this situation arising
sentenced on the basis of testimony extracted under torture without the means to employ qualified defence counsel without a chance of finding files lost five or fifteen years ago they await their execution in inhuman conditions
from an ecological point of view we should open the way for cabotage transport immediately but from a social and economic point of view it makes better sense to limit it for the time being
the same evaluation of the past stalins gulags and the fascist holocaust would strengthen european citizenship
i would therefore ask you to ensure that independently of the friday issue which we cannot now resolve wednesdays come fully into their own again in other words a full one and a half hours should be set aside for question time for the right to ask questions is a fundamental right of every parliamentarian
if people in any of our member states wish to hunt they can still continue to hunt
mrsgebhardt on behalf the group of the party of european socialists mentioned the and tragedies i will not remind you of this problem but we know that it led to considerable environmental damage
i think we have better things to do than to promote controversial research
as my party leader in dil éireann enda kenny said robert mccartneys vicious beating and stabbing to death was ordered by a commander in the belfast brigade of the provisional ira following a minor dispute between the commanders uncle and the group with which mr mccartney was socialising
not only do they generate quality products but they are also the only means of maintaining sites and keeping them secure
the reasons for this relate on the one hand to the competences and power of the wto and on the other hand to the problem that i have already mentioned namely the developing countries lack of negotiating capacity
iter technical objectives and design are based on the steady and scientifically rigorous prospect process of development in fusion research worldwide which has witnessed dramatic increases in the performance of experimental fusion facilities over recent decades in an atmosphere of international scientific cooperation that has transcended political barriers
it is also gratifying that mr vitorino will be attending that meeting and i welcome his statement that what we discuss at it should impact on the commissions further plans and in turn needless to say also on the decisionmaking in the european council on 5 november
the european council will not over the coming weeks be taking any decisions about the most recent reports by the commission but they will be discussed and presented
at the very beginning of february my colleagues and i wrote to commissionerdimas to ask this question
there is no reason whatsoever for demanding changes or a review of the un conventions on drugs
no effort must be spared against the endless horrors of terrorism
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting see minutes
no later than early october we will review the situation with those outstanding issues
multilateralism which remains the best way to achieve global peace and security is indeed one way of guaranteeing that we avoid the supremacy of one superpower
no one mentions the crucial issue of the principle of respect for the right of ownership
they are all denied by the ira by word and by deed on a regular basis
let me repeat negotiation with iran not escalation and war
the paucity of payment appropriations is a particular threat to structural policy which is one of parliaments major priorities
we must discuss this matter again as soon as possible and then adopt a motion
what we clearly have to do now is create fewer problems for the surrounding community but we also have to remember that the community often builds up around the airport because of the activity of that very airport because of the economic development it generates and the infrastructures which accompany it
as an example i might mention the speech given in brussels by finlands second minister of finance at the beginning of the finnish presidential term
this is the reason for the amendment to the interinstitutional agreement iia which established the financial framework for 20072013 increasing the ceiling for authorisations granted under subheading 1a competitiveness for growth for the years 2008 to 2013 to a total of eur 1 600 million at current prices at the cost of underbudgeting and underimplementing the items under heading 2 preservation and management of natural resources namely agriculture fisheries and the environment in 2007
france recently gave us a lamentable example of this
what will their scope be
b502132001 by mrs fraisse and others on behalf of the guengl group on the situation in afghanistan including the destruction of the cultural heritage
i would like to end on a slightly more serious note the group that i chair the union for europe of the nations group was struck by the first remarks that you made regarding the need to protect the diversity of our cultures because europe will become stronger by adding the characteristics of each nation and not by trying to get rid of these differences which is what some are seeking to do
the principle would be to strive for common legislation on both sides of the atlantic
carbon is a black solid it is soot or graphite or diamonds
perhaps naiades inspires us and perhaps the commissioner should take note and appoint two women coordinators for naiades
those striking out here at a supposed threat to freedom of information in italy a threat that is wholly imaginary are the first to advocate muzzling laws purely and simply aimed at the political elimination of dissidents
so the croatian government has its hands full
as i have already said in the committee on transport and tourism i consider it downright unacceptable to apply this term to cars and roadways
who is working on the details of this aid package
accordingly i am of the opinion that we should implement the protocol and that the report contains a few elements which are not conducive to this process
such tragic events have become a frequent occurrence off the unions southern mediterranean and atlantic coasts especially near the canary islands and andalusia and are a black mark on europes conscience
if a majority of europeans believe that the eu should not be further enlarged those elected by the people ought to heed what they are saying
unfortunately i have to add a sour note to the proceedings
firstly for the achievement of its economic and monetarypolicy objectives the union has hard law specific objectives penalties if need be large amounts of money and tough action whereas fundamental rights and freedoms at european level have only soft law
while i have to say that i listened to what you had to say about migration with a great deal of admiration i would also like to point out at the same time that migration is an admission of failure for we should deal with problems where people actually live that is where we have to start
member of the commission madam president i am grateful for the opportunity to discuss this very important topic
deployment of minurcat is all the more important because the commission made arrangements for a programme to monitor the legal and prisons system in 2007 and reform the security system by 20082011
however the eastern partnership must not be used to stall the eu membership ambitions of countries manifestly entitled to apply for such status namely ukraine and moldova
however we are not starting from scratch
if the commission is intent upon developing motorways of the sea promoting sea transport and establishing shipping links as part of the transeuropean network seafaring countries such ireland must be given equal treatment
i shall present these proposals to you at the second plenary session of january
it is in fact vitally important that we should maintain the winemaking traditions of chaptalisation that are carried on in many regions of europe including burgundy and franche comté which i happen to represent
that is why in view of the need to improve relations between the european union and the un which is key to creating a panorama in which there is respect for human rights and international legislation we believe we should have gone a little further in terms of improving the conditions for greater justice in the world
goodbye koruna welcome euro
so we have not succeeded in our original aim of maintaining the population in rural areas
for this reason the european budget the mediumterm financial plan must cover five years and therefore be linked in political terms to the responsibility of an elected commission and an elected parliament
proposals on energy and climate change debate
these defects have been exacerbated by the agreement in the lead committee which would produce rigid and bureaucratic regulations
these are essentially densely builtup areas that are deprived socially economically and in terms of housing
the march european council decided on a more restrained format to my great regret
workers then have no job at all
as i have already stated we have inquired long enough we must now implement the measures we have been talking about
the second is the eu response to the procedural breach by the moldovan authorities in implementing their agreements with us and by discriminating against european citizens on nationality grounds
it represents a call to base the eurussian relationship on the foundation of mutual trust and respect for the principles laid down in the energy charter
in my opinion the debate as a whole has demonstrated that extremely complex questions can be asked about the extent to which the proposals that have been presented speak for everyone
i think that our cooperation has been constructive and has proceeded in a pleasant and open atmosphere
finally i drew attention to the great importance of mobility in improving the situation on the european labour market
these attacks especially the attack on the life and health of opposition leader lebedko seem to have been well targeted and prepared
iwill vote for it and iassure you that iwill monitor the area of healthcare very closely and carefully
as with mr daul we met and had discussions and there are no secrets
pl may i begin by thanking the commissioner for a very comprehensive response on this subject
originally we proposed to do that in the report that we are dealing with now and we were disappointed that a majority of the committee did not support it
i would however like to warn mr duff about the work of the committee on constitutional affairs
the ppede group has tabled other amendments which are equally nonsensical and will not enhance the standing of the european parliament if adopted
the area where we lag furthest behind is that of research
we must not have agencies just so that all the member states can have their baby
in order to succeed a comprehensive approach is indeed required allowing our ambitious energy and climate targets to be reconciled with our objectives in the areas of economic growth and employment
we are very pleased with that
flooding in the low countries of europe is not permitted to get out of hand the dutch government has made great efforts to fight back
it must be tight and it must be fair
intensive work was done by both the commission and the eu member states to for example make up the financial deficit for the new university in tetovo offering teaching in albanian and to try to rapidly implement measures to rebuild houses destroyed in the villages north of tetovo and support other projects to strengthen interethnic cohesion in the country
member of the commission es mr president first thank you all especially the rapporteurs but also all the other people who have spoken in the debate for your involvement and cooperation in improving statistical governance in the european union and via the second committee reform for improving users involvement in the economic and social life of europe with the aim of achieving a better statistical system a more credible system
i heartily congratulate my group colleague mr hammerstein mintz on this crucial report as it cuts to the heart of so many of the problems the eu faces today
that concludes the list of speakers
the bse and footandmouth crises indicate a lack of confidence
the second topic is the preparation of the midterm review of the lisbon strategy
it is also likely that too many priorities were set
but we could at least ensure that our citizens understand what we are doing in their name
our relationship must be much more extensive than a mere free trade agreement
they were the subject of debates within the convention
jobs cannot be created without businesses and businesses cannot come into being without entrepreneurs people with the spirit of initiative and a taste for taking on risk
i have to tell the presidentinoffice that what the council is actually doing is forcing parliament to have recourse to sharper weapons for she will have seen how the committee on budgets did not release the funds for the new agencies even though we actually want them
subsidiarité oblige
since that time oil prices have increased dramatically
the cinema has already sounded the alarm bells with the film le père noël est une ordure
members of this house may think otherwise but this is a cynical attempt to hijack the games in order to promote the european agenda
it is now clear from the last debate that milk quotas will be abolished from april 2015 and i welcome the commissioners contribution to this debate
i would very much appreciate it if you could give this matter serious thought and take it into account during planning
as a result we have received amendments concerning the common agricultural policy environmental aspects oil and gas trading and so on some of the amendments are farremoved from reality and would be better placed in the dustbin of the history of socialism than in the context of the modern welfare state and i cannot therefore lend them my support
with regard to the important and sensitive problem of asylum however i believe we should encourage the perhaps belated efforts to relocate the examination of asylumseekers files and situations to the territories of third countries where it should come within the political and social remit of those countries and i am thinking of the african countries here
i therefore call on the council to reformulate its mandate for this committee
de madam president commissioner although europeans traditionally like a drink alcohol consumption has been declining for years even without taxes and health warnings
that is a fundamental principle and in quoting that example i am also stressing the importance of the political dialogue between the commission and those countries authorities
this is by no means completed and we therefore continue working closely with the palestinian authority on reform conditions for our support during this year
we shall see instances of restructuring
it is being said that if it is not approved in the new ten the same process as in nice will be followed namely the referendums will be repeated a year later in those countries
i would like to call for a realistic approach to kozloduy
this requires everyone to make an effort and time is our only priority
thank you for bestowing on me today the honour to do so
a lot of people are talking about this but very little gets done
i have to say however that whilst we are finding out more and more about what the exprime minister of portugal covered up between 2002 and 2004 the results of his initiatives as the head of the european commission to get the union out of this grey area of nonlegality remain completely unknown to us
mr president ladies and gentlemen we must therefore endeavour to ensure that the donors conference will enable us to establish a general framework to do whatever is necessary to contribute to the reconstruction of the country the presidency considers that for europe which has already clearly indicated its desire to take part in the reconstruction of iraq this is a valuable opportunity to make use of its resources and experience
they have done what they have done for years
the accumulated fraud with eu funds gives cause for concern as do a number of situations in the institutions i wish briefly to refer here to the court of auditors most recent special report on the support system for oilseeds
i hope that you will tomorrow say that with the same clarity to the president of the united states
i also supported in particular the rapporteurs suggestion to involve the candidate countries more closely before they join the union
i thought i ought to vote in favour of amendment29 which abolishes the nutrient profiles proposed by the commission
i think now is the time for the institutions of the european union to react vigorously to defend this european tradition its political essence is very important and it is vital for the maintenance of intellectual creativity
both countries have achieved a lot but we too still have something to do in order to improve our enlargement policy
it should aim to send out alarm signals to the effect that if essential reforms are not undertaken europe is likely to stagnate and fall behind
we need to give level three committees more decisive powers
converging vat
it is useful and necessary to be able to guarantee insurability
we could return to the subject at a later stage in another way and produce some costings and a tighter more comprehensive proposal as to how we will put the ideals expressed in this report into effect
this subject which has been under discussion for a long time was covered by the 2001 international treaty on plant genetic resources for food and agriculture
it is tempting to use such a solution to try not only to increase levels and ratios of employment but also to reduce the pressure on the pension systems
i would say to you commissioner that the ball is now in the commissions court we are all aware that in order to monitor the implementation of this legislation in many fields legislating here is not enough the texts need to be transposed in the member states
i must also issue a warning about the risk of business concentration that adopting these measures could entail and i believe that rightly
in the guidelines we have agreed upon in the committee on economic and monetary affairs we emphasise the need for a more flexible labour market better conditions for business and concentration upon productivity and competitiveness through more open markets
we also know that we are facing extreme climate changes which are not least due to the fact that too much fuel is being used by the transport sector
we are of course talking about lower quality honeys which are used as raw materials in certain preparations in the agricultural and food industry but there is no question of accepting the presence of harmful substances
you will see from the response that you and your assistant have the support and i am sure the sympathy of all members of this house
consequently i did not have the chance to express my approval for the staes report concerning discharge for section i parliament itself
here in europe your birth rates and death rates have dropped dramatically
i have just met belaruss opposition leader mralexandermilinkevich
in my opinion we should aim to eliminate the existing imbalances and introduce new rules and payments in all member states as quickly as possible otherwise regional inequalities will intensify
they simply said this is what we want and what we need to diversify our energy supply
it is better to fail to accomplish than to accomplish failure
i headed a parliamentary delegation to chechnya last year
there perhaps has to be a certain irony that we as legislators spend much of our time demanding change and modernisation of those we legislate for
the commission cannot accept amendments nos 1 to 4 and 6 to 16
this does not seem to be the case
as i see it our honour as meps is at stake and i hope that you will put your trust in the artist that i am and that you will support the two amendments that give hope to european artists
such central contact points will explain to consumers to whom they may address their complaints and seek appropriate redress
only together in a more effective way can the european union tackle the challenges of the globalised world
if we give up six to nine billion and if we follow this model then the anticipators will clearly always be right
you are right on that point mr harbour you have to decide to give priority to a number of them
i know that in the fisheries council the uk germany france the netherlands and denmark have all expressed similar concerns so as ms stihler said this is a resurrection of the old northsouth divide which i thought had disappeared long ago and that is something that we do not want to see coming back
mr president we always talk about renewable energy when we talk about prices
ccs is not a dangerous technology it is a helpful technology
europe may have become calmer but hopefully not too calm because it must be heard so that the citizens can enter into a dialogue with it
thirdly in iraq there are tens of thousands of iranians opposed to the regime in their own country as well as kurdish refugees from turkey
the ombudsmans report particularly the executive summary is i believe an excellent example of how to present our work to the citizens
in recent times the strikes have also led to the interruption of the export of aluminium ore which is guineas most precious asset
mr hoon has even said that there is no concept of a european rapid reaction force as such
that is why i am surprised that a report such as mrs stihler s can coexist within this chamber with militant speeches in favour of decriminalising the use of cannabis or against the death penalty
she has had a very difficult task getting a consensus on this issue is impossible
the commission will be presenting a proposal at the beginning of next year
the european parliament which for years has been committed to upholding the fundamental rights of all citizens already adopted a resolution on the issue in 2001
this opportunity offers promising prospects to the most vulnerable areas of my region which is something that i welcome
on the other hand however listening to the speeches by mrs ferrerowaldner and mr solana i was not really convinced that the reasons for north koreas actions have been thoroughly analysed
that was the decision of the commission today
substances permitted in such places as italy luxembourg and belgium cannot be banned in austria or germany
it is also important to mark the importance of this item of legislation
in the words of a human rights watch representative the human rights commission in effect became the abusers club because abusive governments were eager to be part of it in order to block action on themselves and on countries elsewhere
firstly the redefinition of the european agricultural model cannot neglect familybased small and mediumsized enterprises
these other things included a social europe which you said was a matter for the nationstates
its production is supported and subsidised by the eu
i wonder how the people in the public gallery feel about the 5 8 of european taxpayers money from the gbp 98 billion 2001 budget that the commission controlled going missing through fraud mismanagement or waste about the eur 15 billion surplus money that could not be spent because of inefficient programming about the specific problems that we found when we debated these points specifically eurocost comes to mind about the leaked emails and memos within the commission that show how bad the accounts actually were in 2001
we must revise the systems of packaging industrial logistics the organisation of production chains etc with a view to preventing raw materials intermediate goods and end products from having to be moved further than is essential
in my view the european union has two choices either we harmonise at a high ambitious level or we continue to allow the member states to retain their stricter more ambitious targets and measures
the repressive measures however will not be able to stop the fight by the workers against this warmongering antilabour autocratic policy and the promising march to claim satisfaction of their contemporary needs
an example the amount of sugar to be contained in different kinds of wine should in fact be left to the consumers who buy the products themselves to decide
perhaps this says something about the work we do in the background before we pronounce so that we do this in a good way and send out the proper message to the public that we are supporting the developing world and the hungry and the needy
it was going to do so today after a hunger strike that has lasted 33 days yet an attempt is being made to prevent us from debating the matter
we must take the results of the european elections into account and all i can say is that we will proceed in accordance with the approved standard procedure because we are in a kind of legal vacuum and in a situation that must be dealt with politically and in practical terms
how can a consumer defend his rights if the document creates prerequisites for ambiguous interpretation of financial business responsibility
the union for europe of the nations group has requested that a commission statement on the earthquake in the italian region of abruzzo be inserted into the agenda
the councils response to the tragedies involving refugees in the mediterranean is to set up socalled rapid border intervention teams a term that seems to imply particularly in english sending in commando troops against refugees
how could it not call on the european council and the commission to send a solemn warning to states that subscribe to this aggressive logic and even voice it since history has taught us all too often that actions are unfortunately never far behind such remarks
lastly in this context i regret the cuts in support for candidate countries the ipa regional development and human resources instrument which addresses areas such as unemployment social exclusion and education investment a cut of eur 7 million which is 05 of the available operational credits that go to administration without regard to the need of ensuring good local administration and without regard to the basic principles of good financial management which is so dear to this house
apart from anything else energy security is one of the main priorities of our presidency and the need for it was demonstrated in january
you could of course claim that the fisheries policy is only partly being launched but i should nevertheless like to mention a few points concerning the fisheries policy
the regulation on energy projects constitutes a significant tool to achieve two goals responding to the key security issues and environmental challenges in the energy sector whilst at the same time contributing to the recovery of our economy
the commission has taken important steps over the past years to develop a policy to improve the security of electronic communications
we must also work on the leitmotiv of the territorial dimension which is polycentrism and of course the use of new technologies
firstly to make our citizens aware of what victims of terrorism go through how they suffer and to ensure greater representation of victims interests at european level
the rules in force condemn us to slow muddled procedures where the most effective measure a fine is rarely applied and only after a very long time decades even
obviously we are in favour of aid for oppressed nations such as the palestinians but at the same time we say that the councils priority areas are eating into the reserves for the targets of financing that parliament deems important
here we arrive at a key policy issue in which parliaments work under the leadership of my colleague peter liese is extremely important
that is why the fight against climate change which requires the help of all countries needs none other than the most advanced countries to lead the way
possible measures include a public farmers insurance scheme financed by community funds enabling farmers to receive a minimum wage in the event of public disasters of this nature
would sweden like to initiate this
unfortunately disasters will continue to happen
that means i hope mrs mckenna is listening that everything is compatible with the european convention on human rights
on behalf of the ppede group de mr president our resolution deals with the humanrights situation in iran and the dispute over the iranian nuclear programme
this is where mr prodi ought to begin instead of issuing further empty promises about more transparency and a closer relationship with the people
i believe the european parliament has been at the forefront of these negotiations and has served as a touchstone a number of speakers have already made this clear
the commission is also involved in the working party set up to implement the framework for action set out in dakar
the others exceeded it for between 10 months and almost six years from the end of 1998 to the end of 2005
again in that spirit i would like to thank mr poettering for what he said which falls into that category
emissions trading must be improved
all i would say in connection with the working party on the internal reform of parliament is that conduct of question time is one of the issues that we are looking at very carefully and your comments will be taken on board
if i may use commercial language the un is actually a brand
my thanks also go to my personal assistant and to the staff of the groups it takes many heads and many hands to do a good job
his family have stated that they know piotr is not an important figure in the world of top level politics but they trust everything that can be done will be done to secure his release
for the last two years running a third of honey bees in the usa have mysteriously died
it answers my question in principle but this is not a problem of principle
the eu has encouraged israel to start to withdraw from its settlements
that weakens the credibility of our foreign policy
it was during the past year that the commission first presented them and i am grateful to your house for giving them such close attention for they will be a guide not only during this year but also thereafter to what we are considering doing and to the basis on which we will be doing it
work fast
three of them were then burned and they were offered as a set of nine at a higher price each time the price goes up and the quality goes down
our money must be conditional upon very specific reforms in this society
mr president it is important that we be given the opportunity of discussing the financial framework in good time and of voting on it in the parliamentary committees at regular intervals
if the pact is to become more flexible this should be done on the basis of objective and general criteria
the next item is the report a601072006 by mrspletinsk on behalf of the committee on internal market and consumer protection on the financing of european standardisation com20050377 c602522005 20050157cod
in the report parliament underlines above all the importance of reliable inland waterways
i expect much more from governments that are aware of the problem but in that case we must also be prepared to support those governments and increase their administrative efficiency
you also know that the commitment from the member states is totally voluntary
mr president as far as romania and bulgaria are concerned the council would like to point out to the honourable member that the accession negotiations with bulgaria about chapter 24 justice and home affairs were provisionally completed in october 2003 and that a supervisory process has been set in motion
it mr president this debate has shown us how the italian left is increasingly far removed from the sentiments shared by our people
i am thinking about the establishment of a constitutional state and the way in which we the european union backed by our extensive experience with the contribution we can make to restoring a true independent legal body with judges who truly render judgment with everything that is involved in this and what is important can train these people and give them guidance
you have a big pr exercise minister if what you say is accurate rather than that which the german president of the council says
we are working together with the three level three committees on these tasks to deliver the requested results before the end of the year
an expert has made an assessment of this agreement
even though these declarations can be agreed upon in the main they are at times inconsistent particularly in their attempts to harmonise increased employment with job development measures and above all in attempting to reconcile job flexibility with job security without specifying how this is to be achieved
now that we have reduced this deficit and in actual fact anticipate a slight surplus for next year we note that in a longterm perspective it is in all likelihood specifically 2003 that will be the big problem
if this were in fact the issue the aforementioned conclusion would not require any comment
these are all questions that arise and need to be answered
the discriminating regulations in force contradict the political requirement for the strengthening of the european identity
this is just the sort of approach we need to ensure that something like this never happens again
the european union and the united states are working on common strategies for dealing with emerging threats such as terrorism the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction rogue states and organised crime
goodquality effective and simple legislation in the internal market should open up opportunities for crossborder trade and give consumers increased choice while protecting environmental social and consumer rights
the same is true of the package of existing and forthcoming measures on the financial system
we understand that today belaruss visiting card unfortunately implies the lukashenko regime
i believe they will then be able to play a big part
on behalf of the vertsale group de mr president if you want to judge how far ukraine has progressed in becoming a democracy all you have to do these days is to look at moscow and kiev both at the same time a comparison between them shows that light years separate the two in terms of respect for democracy and that confusion and disorder notwithstanding it is in a much more stable state in kiev than one could have hoped three or four years ago
and given the speed of many processes there will be some citizens who do not receive the documents in their language and will hardly have the opportunity to present amendments on time
its main aim is to simplify and consolidate the existing legislation
in approving this report we are making a series of recommendations which when implemented will allow us to create a common definition within the european union of the crime of terrorism to adopt the principle of mutual recognition of judgments to replace the formal extradition procedures with a european search and arrest warrant for those crimes which cause particular revulsion in society i am talking about terrorism of course but also human trafficking crimes against children illegal drug and arms trafficking corruption fraud and organised crime
this is an inalienable right not only guaranteed in law but also defended in practice
i therefore have no problem agreeing when our groups shadow rapporteur mrs sommer draws attention to a strategy for preventing the dangers associated with alcohol
we hope to see the oilforfood programme which is and should be managed by the united nations restarted shortly the secretarygeneral has made this clear
the cause for the shortfall in educational facilities lies not only with the donors
please take that as the first message because we need to win the hearts and minds of the people out there who think that we produced a diluted and weak piece of legislation
they demonstrate very clearly how efficient and effective this knowledge is
i think with the great austrian sense of composition the austrian presidency made a very important contribution to our common project
our political position against discrimination must be converted here in this house into policy
secondly there was a remark about cuban participation in the joint euacp parliamentary assembly as long as cuba is not a party to the cotonou agreement that participation is the answer
the committee on development has proposed that all regional budget lines contribute to achieving the sizeable recurrent contribution needed
let us care about them
to be effective it must be properly attuned to the needs of modern society
i am thinking about the role the union should be playing and is not
this seems to me to run completely counter to all the eus documents to contradict the charter of fundamental rights of the european union and also the resolution we adopted this morning on the rights of the child
pl mr president it is a good thing that the world is no longer divided between the warsaw pact and nato
for thousands of european citizens however these debates pass over their heads
the next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of thursday 28 june 2001
this anniversary then gives us a particularly apt message of hope for todays times
europe is not there to impose changes for the worse on the member states or to deny the member states the scope to adopt decent environmental policy
if you have an elected parliament you have to listen to what it says otherwise these people in the gallery are wasting their time and we are wasting our time in coming here
unless there is a dramatic upswing in the birth rate this will have serious repercussions it will impact on the financial capacity of the system on the balancing of public accounts and also on individuals
we regret rather that the eu still intends to conclude destructive new fisheries agreements and to extend existing agreements
we regard the accusations as unproven but the way in which the two people were held in solitary confinement and ultimately sentenced to death after months of incarceration and after a mockery of a trial confounds us
i am deeply ashamed that the british government is refusing to accept this aid refusing to apply for this cofinanced aid
there are two reasons for this firstly the global agricultural and food product crisis and secondly market concentration which has increased from 217 in 1990 to over 70 at the moment

applause
you showed how disappointed you are which is no surprise after a second negative arbitration decision
mr president the preparations for the accession of bulgaria and romania to the european union are taking place during a period of crisis in europe
there is no question of that
b502202001 by mr queir and mr ribeiro e castro on behalf of the uen group floods in mozambique
is it in italy that we change the law on audiovisual advertising in favour of our friends
it is also right that we should welcome the progress croatia has made and that we should urge the european union to do its utmost to provide a legal basis for croatias accession to the european union
members of this house in particular then noticed that when a week before the vote in committee a newspaper suddenly describes as brand new a document that was distributed here in the house months before basically an attempt is being made to orchestrate them
3
however in addition to broad consensus on the design of policies which i regard as having been achieved we must also be more demanding in terms of achieving consensus on political action
we must wield this instrument with far more determination and vigour indeed in my view the greater our resolution in influencing the passage of european legislation on environmental matters the greater our credibility will be in johannesburg and of course at future conferences too
do not fight globalisation join it by encouraging competition within the eu and learn how to compete on world markets
we would therefore like to ask the commissioner whether he is in a position to assure us that this objective still stands for the date scheduled 2012
after investigating my complaint for a year the european ombudsman decided that the european commission did not infringe the citizens right to equal access to information
this would create actual room for knowledge innovation in the countryside and in the urban areas with priority being given to the ten new acceding countries
mr president as has been said 2006 has been declared the european year of workers mobility
mr president i wish to refer to two aspects of this debate
now is the time for active inclusion to step up efforts to give particular support to these groups a very clear echo of the lambert report on the agenda today
we have to consider whether future initiatives like these will require us perhaps via the convention to take a new path in order to achieve sensible solutions in the interests of security and also of parliament
it is our duty not only to express our solidarity but also to play an active part in the reconstruction of the parts of the island that have been devastated
however they also need to consider whether to assist those who want to leave kalimantan permanently and return to madura
this is a crucial improvement in terms of transparency and democratic control in the eu
the commission realises the importance however of implementing article 7 of the treaty of nice before the charter can take full effect
we should remain firm on reducing the obligation but the procedure is very much open to discussion
i therefore look forward to the measures envisaged in the report to contain the spread of terrorism particularly the european search and arrest warrant and the abolition of the formal extradition procedure
in fact as you might imagine we had lengthy debates on setting a threshold of between eur 1 000 and eur 4 000 above which the resale right would apply arriving at a compromise of eur 3 000 which is a reasonable amount
the complaint has not been processed by the bulgarian public prosecutors office since june owing to public incitement to murder
this was your objective mr presidentinoffice of the council and i welcome the fact that the latest known us proposals seem to be moving in that direction
i have received one motion for a resolution in accordance with rule 1032 of the rules of procedure
thirdly the report stresses that the revised stability and growth pact is a key instrument for maintaining budgetary discipline in the member states
in its documents to date the european parliament has continuously urged croatia to settle unresolved border issues with neighbouring countries through bilateral agreements
on the one hand the need to strengthen administrative capacity in the implementation phase of the new cohesion policy through the setting up of a network of accredited trainers in order to implement all training measures and in particular to implement them at all levels especially at local level where i believe most work needs to be done
lastly i should like to emphasise that in order for economic and national employment policies to be effectively coordinated and coherent and to guarantee the effective achievement of the european employment strategy the possibilities of the open method of coordination must be improved and exploited without losing sight of the requirement for this method always to make transparency its top priority
it is a well known fact that there is no effective public control mechanism of secret services and their undemocratic activities anywhere in the world
my only criticism of this resolution is that it has come too late
my request is therefore simple mr barroso withdraw the bolkestein directive and initiate a broad debate on the subject
mr alavanos has the floor for a point of order i would ask you to be brief
so the challenge of guantnamo the problem posed by 245 suspects floating outwith the justice system is not an issue for america alone
i would simply say to you mr prodi that i have here the amendments that have been lodged
i know that the council attaches great importance to small and mediumsized enterprises and recognises that these constitute the backbone of our individual economies and of our european economy in general
concerning category 1 of the financial perspectives for agricultural expenditure the draft budget has taken into consideration the implications of the decisions taken by the european council of berlin in march 1999 concerning the reorganisation of the common agricultural policy

the newspaper did not name the countries concerned for security reasons but let us note that an investigation led by the human rights watch organisation indicated that in 2002 a number of ghost prisoners were in fact detained by the cia
we must also harmonise the principles for recognising administrative documents in order to make the everyday lives of our citizens easier and to make it simpler for businesses to operate
most of the issues raised in the report confirm the policy orientations set out in the strategy outlined in the commissions communication
in my view mrcrowley among others is right to say that the two are not mutually exclusive by any means
my report therefore calls on the council of ministers to establish common minimal laws and penalties to counter terrorist acts to abolish formal extradition procedures for those suspected or convicted of terrorist crimes and to establish a european search and arrest warrant in the fight against terrorist groups
mr president experience has taught me that when bureaucrats and politicians resort to jargon citizens should guard their wallets
until now the financial markets were able to develop very freely
i find it hard to understand the stance adopted by the governments of certain member states of the old fifteen
we must find a solution if we are to regain any credibility in this context
we cannot base our efforts to protect the climate on hiding pollution away for future generations
madam president i welcome this package in principle but we must recognise that renewables and efficiency gains are a domestic eu asset which yields benefits for us both as a sustainable lowcarbon economy and for security of supply

first the mechanism created by the wto decision of august 2003 and the protocol to the trips agreement is the result of long and difficult negotiations between almost 150 countries
mr president it is the people with least resources who suffer the worst health
ladies and gentlemen first of all i believe that this debate is leaning towards recognition of the need to structure the political debate on how to regulate globalisation
this situation has changed it has now become a problem for us too
now that the directive has been examined by the various european institutions there is little left of its original good intentions
so we are still striving towards a positive outcome of the doha round
now we are waiting for a response from the six countries which have a direct interest in the programme
it is very important for the kashmiris to be involved as well in finding a solution to the problem for there will be no durable solution to the problem in kashmir as long as freely and democratically elected kashmiri leaders are unable to take part
all indications suggest that isolation from globalisation brings greater risks in terms of poverty effects than if a country participates in globalisation
demagogic
my group is of the opinion that such delicate implementation calls for a stable and permanent financial framework recognised by all
thank you very much
it is difficult to explain to the european public why for example the prince of monaco or large multinationals such as heineken and nestlé receive hundreds of thousands of euros in income support in the form of agricultural subsidies merely because they own some land whilst real farmers often struggle to make ends meet
we insistently and constantly call for the selfevident for human rights and fundamental freedoms to apply equally to men and women with no discrimination whatsoever
the heads of state and government did not do that in december because the tasks included creating a legal status for the european union to put an end to the situation whereby the commission can go over the communitys head because it is a member of the fao with a seat and vote and whereby in political matters we have no legal personality in nairobi geneva or vienna and so cannot act
there were very few guests but the debate was extremely high quality i am told
throughout the negotiation process parliaments interventions on various important issues have contributed towards securing the ambitious level of targets originally proposed by the commission
in fact commissioner there are plenty of discussions and rumours afoot and perhaps todays debate will help clarify matters
it is impossible even to contemplate
i am being mildly provocative in saying this the commission is divided
it is equal to an meps per diem
for these reasons in 2008 the commission will develop a complete initiative to improve disaster prevention generally
what message do you have
in the face of all this the practical immediate solution that emerges from the report is to invite companies and citizens to encrypt documents as if the indissoluble link between cryptographic code breaking and technical interception systems were not well known
in other words the research and knowledge must be found to be proper and correct and therefore reliable
thirdly the approach taken in the motion to the issue of legal data collection leaves the way open for what is extremely dangerous indifference in this area to continue
my concern is that the united states courts are currently preventing this type of manoeuvre from being carried out close to the coasts of the united states which implies that military manoeuvres mainly carried out by the united states are being diverted to the coasts of the european union
why are so many of my constituents living in poverty
of course it would be an illusion to think we can solve water problems by pumping water from areas of supposed surplus to areas where there is a shortage
but alcohol causes major problems throughout society from health problems to violence to abuse against other people and the persons themselves
if we can work together to raise awareness we can tell all the citizens of europe the story referred to by mr chichester the story that european space projects can be the cause that brings us all together
even basic information on pollution was labelled a state secret

el madam president as far as i know we allow each commissioner 20 minutes
mr president i accept the reasons that the conference of presidents had in the first place for keeping separate the debate about the substance of the proposals which we are all very anxious to be getting on with
therefore it is absolutely imperative to prepare for that time we have to upgrade and modernise our educational system and we have to progress with analysing and searching to ascertain what these new skills and jobs might be
that turkeys accession is problematic has nothing to do with cyprus so let us not act as if cyprus could be used as a means of resolving the problem of turkeys accession
mr president both my party the league of polish families and my political group the independence and democracy group always have been and always will be opposed to the creation of a constitution for the whole of europe
while honouring our commitments on enlargement we must not lose broad public support for this important part of the eu project
how can we forget article 11 of the maastricht treaty which compels all member states to define and implement a common security policy in line with the united nations charter
mrpresident ukraine a country where presidential elections are shortly to be held currently has two development routes open to it
it may come as a surprise but you are right to criticise the german chancellor and he is right to criticise the government
mr president i think that today we are making history and that the european union and the united states are the two leading characters in the play unfolding before our eyes
parliament voted to reject an amendment motion committing the european parliament to the view that measures dealing with economic migration cannot be adopted until all citizens of the european union have been guaranteed equal rights in respect of free movement
we doubt in particular whether we can even discuss the interinstitutional agreement on budgetary policy and its review
we should not let this slip from our view if we do we shall lose touch as we are doing now by abusing the word marriage in applying it to unions that are not marriage
firstly as far as the trade in counterfeit medicinal products is concerned we were surprised to learn that some of them are being produced in two countries of the european union and then marketed through a third european country namely switzerland
whilst the russian government shares our concern about the situation unfortunately we disagree about the way forward
the strategy must be focused on an improvement to onboard working and living conditions and on professional training
lt madam president commissioner i have a question concerning hivaids prevention
if we really want to be of help in this matter i believe that we must show determination a great deal of composure and given that we disseminate nuclear technology a great deal of humility too
we are at the stage in the first round where we have consulted many stakeholders and different organisations and individuals to have their opinions and to collect different ideas
thanks are therefore due to mrferber mrsguyquint mrstrüpel mrseppänen mrroszkowski and to mrwalter mrbge and mrmulder the vicechairmen
today we remember andrei sakharov whose great intellectual and moral strength can be felt to this day by those who visit his simple grave in the novodevichy cemetery outside moscow and our desire is that the russian people may follow his example that in russia and around the world people may bring to life the ideals of andrei sakharov that great physicist philosopher and campaigner for human rights
of course we cannot rejoice at this because we would have preferred to have come to parliament and talked about the real problems for which people are asking us for solutions but we can take comfort in the fact that at least europe has given a verdict that not even antonio di pietro will be able to question
on behalf of the committee legal affairs and the single market i want to draw attention to those items affecting the court of justice and the court of first instance
by means of this resolution on which there is consensus in the european parliament and i am pleased about that we call upon and encourage the council to take on a strong leadership role at the fifth session of the human rights council and we know that that will not be easy
as mrs redondo jiménez pointed out earlier the use of an active agent is however far more a matter of location local weather conditions and a plants general condition in terms of development and health
as a european i regret the hatred of the western world resulting from the use of the empires bombs sadly it is justified
in the commission itself the presidents cannot control the various directors general even though it is formally the president who is responsible for doing so
the freedom drivers are people with disabilities and high dependency needs who want to enjoy the same freedom of movement that everyone else enjoys and that europe represents
madam president looking at our efficient voting time i think i can make a short but justified remark
it has managed to do so as the code adopted contains significant new elements the importance of which we will gradually discover
it is quite clear that the commission should now be promoting this swiftly and determinedly
as rapporteur i also proposed only minor changes in the committee reading
what are we doing in europe
i know that time is running out and that we have already spent a great deal of time discussing this proposal
but more than anything it teaches us that the 50year old asylumseeking system instigated by the united nations is not working any more
climate protection really must be our absolute top priority particularly now
so i too am adamant
i would like to point out that while we spend relatively modestly something like 04 of the gdp of the union on this policy the farmers for example in denmark and the united kingdom get an average of about eur 19 000 per capita but if you go down to the bottom of the list the half a million small farmers of portugal get eur 1 500
we want this independent review since this can also generate more transparency
risk assessments have shown as mrs ries has just said that the use of pentabromodiphenyl ether carries risks for the environment and public health because this bromidebased flame retardant agent is used in the production of furniture and upholstery
the only thing we have to do and we will succeed in this is to promote the positive aspects of sport over the negative tendencies
that is why we are calling on the european commission to make a fundamental assessment of the national action plans which it receives using the agreed quantitative and qualitative indicators and not to make do with lists of political measures which are neither complementary nor global in nature and which do not get to the root of the problem
were we to ask the citizens of europe whether they would be in favour of allocating money that is not spent to this particular area the vast majority would say yes
mr president i want to thank my colleague mrs doris pack for the valuable work she has done in producing this report
these commitments by member states should now be reaffirmed and action taken to achieve the goal of halving the number of undernourished people by 2015
in a bid to find a solution to these human tragedies the commission and parliament are proposing to organise political dialogues among states and to introduce yet more programmes and cooperation plans
mr president i very much appreciated the commissioners speech she showed clear conviction and also a certain amount of grit and determination in such a sensitive matter as this
mr president i actually know few rapporteurs who are as amenable to this parliaments shadow rapporteurs as mr maaten but still as a dutch person i would say to him that our working relationship was once again excellent for our concerns are those of the netherlands a country which has earmarked some 600 bathing waters and required them to be of good quality and beneficial to the environment and health
you have been following these issues very closely not least through the activities of the temporary committee
that crucial point alone demonstrates that these proposals are a political fudge
presidentinoffice of the council thank you mr president ladies and gentlemen
nobody would understand but if these amendments are adopted the result of the motion would be exactly the opposite
if a majority in this house should now then call for troop levels to be strengthened and in so doing ignore the national reservations of the member states this would defeat the real issues raised in the report and would run counter to my own personal concerns
it is important that we set limit values and that we do so in a sensible way although we already have limit values set in the united kingdom
thirdly the european union must stress the need to improve relations between afghanistan and pakistan as several of you mentioned and to encourage both countries to continue to work actively to strengthen their cooperation notably in the fight against the common challenge posed by terrorism and in all matters relating to drug trafficking
thanks to them we have been able to establish a budget that fully respects parliaments budgetary powers
furthermore this data although certainly significant amounts to longterm predictions and is therefore subject to revision
people in both the old and new member states are meant to benefit from enlargement but instead we keep coming back to the issue of global competition
indeed the northern ireland assembly has been suspended
we have seen them before and we shall see them again
in closing i would like to remind you that 2008 was the european year of intercultural dialogue
hu i wish to draw attention to a matter concerning mr diamandouross report on his activities in 2005 on which the european parliament has already adopted a resolution this year
by treating them as a package we forced the council to move towards us as you know that the council most definitely did not want to adopt two proposals
the structure of the organisation menacingly indicates that the same functions are to be discharged in the areas of both crisis prevention and civil crisis management in the commission and the council
this is a fine initiative
the commission is prepared to consider alternatives but needs to know how the council would like to take this matter forward
securing her borders as well as the provision of increased protection for the iraqi people are both imperatives today
if a country like the united states with its relatively low taxes can reduce them further so too in all likelihood can the eu member states throughout which taxes are significantly higher
it is also important to encourage technology transfer to ensure that locally produced pharmaceutical products can meet internationally agreed standards
in an environment where competition is in this field too ruthless everyone will understand that it is essential to direct all our energies to preventing the brain drain to the united states
we have voted today for an exchange of experience at intergovernmental level
we also want india to participate in galileo our global satellite navigation system and we want to discuss the negotiations on a maritime agreement
hard work is needed and both countries will work hard in the future too just as other countries did during their first period as eu member states
it is also clear that we will have to build on expertise in many fields as well as consulting a wide range of stakeholders
obviously price is linked to quality and equipment
the service sector will certainly expand increasing the attractiveness of the area and supporting the potential for tourism and other sorts of related enterprise
give those measures and those decisions time to work let them prove themselves once they come into operation because i firmly believe that they have their strengths they have their scope and they will pay dividends as we grapple with the worst economic crisis ever to afflict the eu
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on foreign affairs madam president it is an endless political bone of contention that heading 4 is chronically underfinanced
the vote will take place at 11 am
that does not seem fair as these same member states also benefit most from the single market
paradoxically some member states have tried to address the loss of competitiveness that is a natural consequence of rejecting such reform by implementing new measures to protect their markets which only makes the problem worse
i welcome the 6 and 12 mile limit retention but beyond 12 miles i have some very serious concerns about the wording of the documents in relation to access to waters and resources and in relation to relative stability
imagine what british troops feel like seeing that happen and being powerless to stop it
in particular the gas crises needed a quick response
at least every tenth newly infected person is under 25 years old
in the energy industry we have tended to go the way of conventional thermodynamics
i am satisfied that we have now reached a stage where our attitudes towards the export of mercury are being reviewed
i feel that in this situation we must also consider very carefully what sort of support to provide to family members or to the people who although not direct family members themselves have nonetheless taken over the care of another person
lastly there is a series of interrelated matters
he is a christian democrat and so i do not always agree with his decisions indeed on the contrary i sometimes think they are quite wrong but his choice of you as a nominee for this prize is one that i can firmly endorse and i would like to warmly congratulate you not only for myself but also i believe on behalf of most of the members of this house
madam presidentinoffice of the council our parliament welcomes the common positions adopted on 22 january and particularly those adopted on 21 february this year but we think the time has now come to openly give all the necessary political aid to the very forces on the ground that continue to fight under commander massoud i would very much welcome a clear response on this issue
da madam president commission president i am extremely pleased that we now have a legislation package in front of us as this is of course the basis that will enable us to work towards achieving our targets and to demonstrate that the eu can do more than just talk about this
fr while the removal moreover partial and limited of the borders between european union member states constitutes progress the legal and material barriers which we are doing our utmost to strengthen around the union represent a retrograde step towards barbarism
the way i see it it is to your credit that you are undertaking a final rescue bid for the pact because what has become apparent is quite simply that the finance ministers in particular the german and french finance ministers may create european legislation but do not abide by it
as the debate on the constitutional treaty has shown the institutional structure of europe is not properly understood
we have also been considering safety criteria and we wanted to take this subject up once again
i believe it is wrong for croatia and turkey to be punished because the majority of irish people voted no
the group of the european peoples party christian democrats and european democrats is therefore going to vote against the amendments already rejected by the committee on fisheries that have been tabled again with 40 signatures which go precisely in the opposite direction in that they insist that agreements on exchanges of quotas should remain outside the general legislation on licences to fish
as the revised lisbon strategy makes clear communitywide rules underpinning a uniform understanding and implementation of technical standardisation constitute very important tools for creating and sustaining the conditions for policy implementation and hence ensuring the competitiveness and constant sustainable development of the community
above all they safeguard the transparency of party finances which is indispensable and as you will be aware a sensitive point perhaps the most sensitive of all
the scientific research sector has significantly stepped up its efforts to protect animals in recent years however
it would be a mistake however to become complacent and overlook just how much remains to be done to move not only macedonia but the whole region towards a point where a return to instability becomes inconceivable
clearly this would be very detrimental to the internal market and to the entire
if carried it would render amendment 24 irrelevant
i agree with much of what mrswallis says
nor has the commission adequately thought through the budgetary consequences of a voluntary transfer of this kind
i am informed that apart from corruption which is deeply rooted there is as yet not enough control on drug trafficking especially of heroin from afghanistan as some have already mentioned before me which is being sold to northern european countries at astronomical prices
together with the european parliament and with the national parliaments we have staged a very large number of events and most importantly hosted a major informal meeting of foreign ministers in klosterneuburg the results of which i can inform you about in brief
those who try to drive a wedge between the old member states and the new ones imperil the concept of the eu being more than just a free trade area
mr president i think this has been an exciting debate
since the introduction of samesex marriages and civil partnerships is not required under community law it would be difficult for the member states to reach a consensus on amending existing provisions to include samesex partnerships
we must ensure that potential terrorists do not descend on europe and therefore in evaluating this problem i would like to see the need for security being given the highest priority above all other considerations
there are nonetheless important areas of european and international policy on which we must be more adventurous
because despite improved technology and faster cars drivers felt impregnable when driving their cars
the beef and veal sector has been doubly hit by disaster mad cow disease was followed by footandmouth disease the fall in domestic consumption as a result of much exaggerated consumer fears is now joined by a serious decline in our exports to third countries
there is a school of thought which suggests that latvia is currently undergoing one of the most dramatic rescue operations of any financial system in modern european history
therefore i very much hope that the house will endorse the proposals made by the committee on budgets and that they will be successfully defended throughout the course of our negotiations with the european commission and the council
that is why it is crucial for us to ensure that fewer new cannabis users are recruited
i have also written to many governments of europe seeking their support for this political initiative
we need to follow up on these steps by continuously strengthening the cooperation of rescue forces in neighbouring regions and countries improving the qualifications and skills of civil protection experts ensuring widespread use of information technologies and promoting training for and simulation of possible disasters
it states that volunteering contributes about as much to gross domestic product in a wide range of countries as the construction industry or the utilities industry
while waiting for precise information to emerge from the risk assessment in relation to decabde which is also currently in progress amendment no 16 which i have tabled in conjunction with the ppe group and the socialist group essentially proposes a ban on decabde with effect from 1 january 2006 unless the risk assessment in some way exonerates this substance and concludes that decabde does not pose any problems
however violence disfigures any demonstration even one held in an honourable cause
we hope in actual fact that there will be a very strong turnout at the elections
slovenia will be joining it and so the same course is open to all states that have carried out reforms
on behalf of the pse group mr president i welcome marian harkins report on volunteering and congratulate her on her collaboration with colleagues in its drafting
the council has produced a common position which essentially takes into account many of parliaments concerns but a number of grey areas still remain and these are the following
if these conditions are not met the european union should seriously consider withdrawing from the human rights circus it will otherwise run the risk of legitimising rather than condemning human rights violations and surely that can never be the intention
further to the commissions initiative for the production of information source on financial issues in the shape for example of a funding handbook what is also needed is a european development plan containing an uptodate inventory and more detailed information on european waterways which must draw on existing expert studies and reports as well as on the experiences gained by the coordinators
it is crucial
the speed of the new procedure already bore fruit in a case in which i found that the commissions response to a citizens infringement complaint had been unsatisfactory
commissioner ladies and gentlemen it hardly pays for us to doubt these benefits but do not let us forget the problems
we support amendments 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 12 and 14 but cannot support amendments 1 9 10 or 13
the court of auditors does not say in its reports
the commission cares very much about supporting the better representation of women in senior roles and it backs the activities of member states in this regard by collecting analysing and disseminating comparable data for this area supporting networks of interested parties and encouraging the sharing of experience and proven approaches at a european level
what is europe doing
we are concerned here with traditional crimes which affect us partly due to information technology child pornography counterfeiting xenophobia and the trades in drugs human beings human organs weapons etc however we are also concerned here with new types of crime directed against the way in which society operates the spreading of viruses unauthorised access hacking denial of service etc
in order to be able to undertake it however further significant investment is needed
while we do not underestimate the difficulties we do therefore emphasise the importance of rapidly finding a solution to the humanitarian aspect of the crisis to bring an end to the daily deaths without giving in to what is plainly an unacceptable form of political blackmail
the priority of a european legal immigration policy is also a human economic and social necessity
applause
the ecj has produced a new ruling that fundamentally changes the position in this area and makes for greater legal uncertainty in it
for me three things are important in this area
we need urgently to face up to the need to secure our borders and remove those who enter illegally
the european union strongly supports regional integration trade liberalisation and economic cooperation
international organisations need to be present to guarantee free elections elections free of any political or economic pressures from the occupation forces
but i believe there is clearly not one answer to these issues
equally we regret that the proposals we made to maintain planting rights and support the restructuring of wineproducing areas especially family farms small and mediumsized winegrowers and wine cooperatives were not adopted although we note with satisfaction that some proposals were approved notably the proposal advocating the distillation of alcohol intended for drinking
the horror transmitted through our television screens shows us just how necessary it is to get our relief agencies in and working
however there is clear evidence that this shift has not been solely towards purely individual defined contribution schemes
for those countries which have not yet joined the euro area is an increasingly attractive option as demonstrated last week in bratislava when we welcomed slovakia as the newest the 16th member of the euro family
please believe us when we say that this is very important for us
finally madam president mr vakalis report has a specifically european dimension
the commission has kept an attentive eye on the latest developments in ukrainian domestic politics observing with concern the way in which president yushchenkos dissolution of parliament has resulted in deeper division between him and mr yanukovych the prime minister
mr president mr high representative commissioner ladies and gentlemen i should like to touch upon three subjects in one and a half minutes this will therefore be an extremely brief intervention
we should also be considering what we do with sectors that have been orphan sectors in terms of skill developments not least the care sector at the moment and really look at how we can ensure equality there
to conclude we need this naiades programme to be a success and to that end we need to be able to rely on the support of decisionmakers at every level national and regional authorities river commissions and businesses
many seem to rely upon voluntary undertakings by industry and major companies but these alone will not lead to the pledges of ten years ago being fulfilled
the temporary moderation of the prices of traditional energy carriers ought not to induce complacency on the part of decisionmakers nor put to one side the commitments made in relation to renewable energy sources
however on a second level there is the agreement that we should now work towards a european framework in which to embed the national decision
i am thankful mrschüssel that we shall now have more transparency in the council
i should like to emphasise in addition to what has already been said and further to what has been written in the report that if there are 100 million europeans who dedicate themselves to helping some 500 million europeans every day it must not be forgotten that these 100 million europeans who volunteer receive personal gain from so doing not in the financial sense but in the sense of personal fulfilment
however when we examine the content in other words the tools that will enable us to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases i have the feeling that it will not be possible to achieve the targets in 2020 due for example to the climbdown on vehicle emissions and derogations for energy producers in particular
we wanted the money not merely to be repaid we wanted it to repay twice the amount
in todays global economy there is mounting evidence that multinationals registered in the north the majority of them within the european union are actually causing harm in developing countries
whilst it is the parents and not the government who should determine what is right and in the interest of the child it should be possible to reach a suitable solution preferably one where the children are cared for by both parents

the european parliament like all representative institutions is reduced to the role of a fig leaf covering up the scandals which drive people to seek profits at world level
while it has been shown scientifically that tobacco products are harmful alcohol is harmful only when consumed in excessive quantities or by persons who should not drink it
we also recommend a 000 limit for young newlyqualified drivers and professional lorry drivers
obviously any debt which exceeds this level can be deemed unconstitutional which is why i would support the amendment put forward by the alde group to define the limit in this way
in addition to the negotiations which are taking place as we speak in abuja between foreign ministers of the commonwealth there are a number of european union initiatives including the intended visit to the southern african countries by the belgian foreign minister representing the presidency and mr solana the high representative
on behalf of the uen group mr president today we mark another step in the progress of romania and bulgaria towards welcoming them back into the family of democratic nations within the european union

our european policy on belarus should be guided by the principle of supporting society and isolating the authorities and this principle should remain in place until the authorities become democratic
although the ppede group is nevertheless taking part in this debate today it does so aware and with the conviction that the action announced by the israeli authorities to safeguard access to the kiriat arba settlement can only have disastrous consequences for the development of the continuing conflict without genuinely guaranteeing the security of its the settlements inhabitants
throughout the discussion we have had many concerns about universal postal services
do we have such methods

the available biomass wind and water power will not of course be enough we will still need to buy energy from russia and the opec states

this leaves us one last joint challenge the synchronisation of the road maps for completing negotiations with croatia on the one hand and those for the necessary institutional reforms within the eu on the other
mr president ladies and gentlemen european economic and monetary union began on 1 january 1999 and 11 eu member states adopted the single currency at the same time
i am speaking on behalf of the committee on the environment public health and food safety
there is therefore a principle of voluntarism involved and i shall be trying to convince the people with whom i have talks
it is important that when they visit mercosur the honourable members are aware that the latter is defensive about the majority of the issues of interest to the european union industrial tariffs services investments geographical indications and public contracts
that is precisely why the council is convinced that it is good to give national parliaments and national governments some leeway in choosing a sensible date for such a referendum
mr lannoyes amendments have caused confusion in the name of purity when we come to the issue of honey
the member states and the community need to combine their strength to prevent disasters and their impacts and to ensure a rapid and effective european response to major disasters
it is also essential to create a paneuropean crisis map on the basis of which those areas of the european union can be assessed where abject poverty and social exclusion most seriously afflict the roma and nonroma communities and through which the european commission supporting the member states can start the work of desegregation which the governments have been putting off for decades as a result of different political commitments
the proposal the commission presented at the end of last year to introduce a euro 5 standard for vehicles reduces particulate matter from both light commercial vehicles and passenger cars
but we should use our partnership with arab countries to address this extremely important point

measures to build trust also include israel repaying the taxes due to the palestinian authority
the bali action plan the bali roadmap and the adaptation fund are challenges where the european union must take the lead
in order to do that better the un must reform
opposition parties are banned or it is made impossible for them to function
the measures introduced by the european central bank ecb and the commission to combat the current crisis have acted as a buffer and a form of containment but we still maintain as we have often done in this chamber that we find it inconceivable to have a monetary policy disconnected from economic policy
these campaigns should start in schools
i understand what you are doing and i have confidence in it
however in the end its credibility will depend on the way in which it is applied
there is also a parallel with our nationstates in brussels a pack of cigarettes now costs eur 430 of which eur 330 goes as excise duty to the belgian state which spends a few million on antitobacco information programmes
you are perfectly correct
the european institutions must make the fight against the adulteration of food in areas such as meat milk wine and olive oil absolute political priorities which will inevitably mean overhauling the way in which the cap operates
however we have to help them take their decision based on the true facts and in a way counterbalance the aggressive marketing techniques of the tobacco industry which is spending billions of euros
it has been clearly established that there are various influences at play here and thus it seems to me that this is another parameter of the solution
european producers must not be penalised because they respect the demands of the european union and improve our food and for their part consumers need to know that the price increases result from an improvement in that food
order of business see minutes
thirdly are there differences of opinion about the study within the commission
however given the great diversity of rules regional situations competences and responsibilities which characterises this aspect of safety situating plant in terms of urban development planning i believe that we must of necessity invoke the principle of subsidiarity and leave it up to the member states to decide on the minimum distances
in particular the commissions disproportionate emphasis on free trade and investment as engines for development should be balanced with far stronger commitments to binding frameworks for corporate accountability
mr president ladies and gentlemen of the european parliament i am really extremely moved to be standing here before you to present the constitution for europe drawn up by the convention over which i have had the exceptional honour of presiding
we also consider it very important that the current multiannual financial framework for 20072013 be revised and extended to the 20152016 financial years as we proposed
there are a number of institutions ranging from the sas in britain through the german border guards the excellent military police in spain and italy and other countries who since the tragic events of the munich olympics have acquired a great expertise in the response
europe is being called upon to act and parliament itself must take a more active investigative and steering role in such a decisive matter of foreign policy
secondly i must point out that we are talking here about liberalisation and not privatisation
it is creaking under the strain of the mass movement of 21 million migrants a year
it is perplexing that the commission should subsequently attempt through the back door to extend the european unions powers in the areas of freedom security and justice
it is a tragedy 50 000 evacuees thousands of houses destroyed hundreds of public buildings devastated including schools and a prestigious cultural architectural and artistic heritage in ruins
what i can describe to you already however are the most important elements the foundations

they have voted against measures to make certain that we are absolutely clear that people do not abuse the asylum system for terrorist purposes

my final comments are on the report as a whole
i also want to mention one aspect that has come out of the debate
their endeavours were both excessive and inadequate inadequate in that their information activities intelligence and preventive protection measures did not suffice and excessive in terms of the crowd control measures employed by certain sections of the police force this was true only of certain sections of the police force but regrettably methods of crowd control were used which could and should have been avoided
so whether we drink little or much the damage is there
this enormous pessimism has led our populations to express perfectly understandable fears
for that matter the pharmaceutical industry often exaggerates its costs after all huge profits are also made in this sector especially on cosmetics and on products like tranquillisers and vitamins

fortunately the council and parliament reached agreement on a realistic figure for payment appropriations
normally the president does not comment on what speakers have said but on my list it says eur 170 and not eur 170 million so i am happy that the united kingdom has nothing to criticise in this case
but as a mother i mostly beseech those with information on the thugs who perpetrated this act to come forward
all i would say to mr schulz is that when i sat round the table in graz and heard the approach of the 25 ministers on the services directive it was most certainly not because they felt that it was a triumph for socialism
i agree with the previous speaker who said that this concept is reserved for sentient beings
what is more they are statements and nothing is really gained because the work has already been done
we must support those who want to enforce the rule of law
this is particularly disturbing when the food security of the european union is under threat
they are also questions of transparency and control of the common foreign and security policy and of defence policy
nor does this document make any secret of its desire to create a businessfriendly climate
the second matter concerns citizens europe which is having difficulty in taking off and certainly requires a great effort on our part in the area of communications
it is a huge commitment probably the biggest any of us will experience
to my mind the european union should focus more precisely on some achievable objectives where it has leverage
democracy should not be a shadow theatre
combating the drugs scourge is far too serious a matter to be left to individuals who are not prepared to take full responsibility on behalf of the present and future generations
the councils decision last december to allow voluntary modulation may lead to distortion of competition between the farmers of different member states depending on the percentages of modulation that they choose to adopt

pollution is identifiable and measurable

it is not insignificant that 25 elected governments of our member states have all come to the conclusion that this new constitution is the best way forward for the european union
you fought your corner robustly and you demonstrated throughout the campaign all the qualities you will need to be a firstclass president of this house
political lessons should be learnt from this but they must take second place to europe offering whatever aid is needed and whatever aid is requested by the united states to assist the people concerned

the eu and the us have coordinated the initiatives designed to help russia implement disarmament and nonproliferation agreements particularly regarding the multilateral nuclear environmental programme and the destruction of chemical weapons
thirdly i would like to raise the issue of energy poverty which we have discussed before also in connection with the reports which we adopted in committee
nonetheless i shall explain the reasons for my decision
everyone claimed that this was not going to be profitable but it certainly is profitable now with the surge in oil prices
mr president ladies and gentlemen firstly my many thanks go to mr bradbourn for his sterling work and his report
nevertheless it is important to share best practice
madam president i would especially like to thank you for your kindness in inviting the members present to listen to my 17 which are actually 16 explanations of vote apart from anything else because an antifatuzzo amendment has been tabled in the document amending the rules of procedure which seeks to limit the number of oral explanations of vote delivered during voting time to a maximum of three
i accept that
in my opinion he has done a splendid job above all because he has dared to go beyond the minimal standard laid down by the commission
the northern ireland assembly has the responsibility of administering the funds
the commission and the council should develop a cohesive strategy of actions to support the democratic process in ethiopia and introduce mechanisms to counter the deterioration of the human rights situation in that region
pt the contradictions contained in this motion for a resolution to which 31 proposals for amendments have been tabled show that there are considerable differences of opinion on the prospect of enlargement and the objectives that people wish to achieve
it adds to the liveliness of the debate and it also means that the people in the public gallery have something to watch and to listen to in the last half hour rather than having to face an empty chamber
there are depressing educational deficits here and women and children are deprived of even the most rudimentary basic education
clearly therefore and i will conclude by answering some of the questions posed by mr brok the measures adopted by cuba which europe deems to be a violation of fundamental civil and political rights have influenced the unions relations with the country
however as regards supply infrastructures i must regret that in the end we have not been able to use an instrument from the field of transport which has been rejected to a certain extent by this parliament namely transeuropean energy networks which were previously proposed but not in the end accepted
i can only allow you to take the floor again if it concerns a point of order
mr president ladies and gentlemen first of all i wish to welcome this timely debate and congratulate the committee on citizens freedoms and rights justice and home affairs and the rapporteur mr sylla on the report we are today discussing which has demonstrated the ongoing nature of the efforts being made by parliament on protecting fundamental rights in the european union
in naples and in large parts of campania the waste situation has now deteriorated and the consequences can be seen by all but there are problems in other areas as well as can be seen from the number of infringement procedures that italy has collected in the environmental field in recent years
first of all it is not legally binding
without these intruments we will not be able to succeed in establishing this partnership with the member states
at the sab last year we had an agreement with the council to increase the funding for orphan medicines and what do you do this year
to that extent we can be really pleased to be able to agree the third maritime package after all these years
unless there is another decision to reevaluate the excise duty zero remains zero even if increased by a proposed 31
the exact opposite would be a lesson in europe citizenship whereby contests are run and hopefully the contestants are rewarded impartially on their merits
security is one of the most important issues for european citizens particularly as regards the risk of threats on european soil and on that subject the rapporteur has sought to be realistic and to understand the immediacy and nature of the threats and the real danger they pose
the union has thus demonstrated that it is able to speak with one voice and is ready to take action based on values
bananas after all are eaten by children they are eaten by the children of poor families
there is little evidence of parliaments position at first reading
member of the commission when the cap reform was agreed among the ministers in the council in 2003 it was the mandate that was given to the trade and agricultural commissioners
basically this is a measure designed to bring about what has been called the single european sky and the liberalisation of air transport and air navigation at eu level
do we want to have a europe of soldiers in the service of an american empire or a europe of independent citizens who respect fundamental rights
justice it seems is eluding these brave people and so they have come to us
much has been said about solidarity and security
this as far as i am concerned is not satisfactory
it is now for the council to meet us halfway
this is shamefully little given the structural problems of almost all these countries
this also brings with it the risk that the electorate in those countries will favour forces which will promote themselves as protectors of national independence national identity and the national economy
what does this involve
we cannot prevent this what we can do is provide a framework of guarantees and certainties safeguarding fundamental rights so that future legislation has to respect them
it is beginning thanks to the parliamentary forum that we held in brussels last week which was a real success
in writing france has taken upon itself the mission to lead the european agenda for six months in a difficult context created after ireland rejected the lisbon treaty
mrpresident i should like to express my concern at the comments recently made by the eu commissioner for trade petermandelson regarding the negotiations taking place under the auspices of the world trade organisation
whether one agrees with the justification for the war or not everyone now must sympathise with the longsuffering iraqi people who yearn for stability in their country
firstly i have a request for the entire house
i promise you however that we on the committee on budgetary control will still be keeping our eyes open in this area in the future
we are recommending that future commissions do the same at the beginning of their mandates as an expression of the changed political composition of a new commission so showing the importance of political legitimacy and political leadership
this has improved our capacity considerably but it is perhaps not so well known
this pushed these two countries towards a very difficult economic financial and social situation
thousands of people who have been imprisoned without trial tortured and exposed to death threats who have been driven from their homes displaced or subjected to sexual violence are familiar with the name of salih mahmoud osman
given the distress caused by alcohol in many families lives across the eu as well as related illhealth issues i find this result unsatisfactory
it is the situation on the ground that is decisive
the formal proposal itself is already in this parliament and i hope that the legislative procedure will soon lead to its adoption and to preparations for the european year of creativity and innovation
i should also like to thank commissionerverheugen however as he has managed by way of better regulation to create a new instrument namely european standardisation to enable the objective to be achieved faster and more efficiently
we ought therefore to know whether the european union wants to achieve its objectives and whether the member states are willing or not to contribute to common policies
i invite you for the next two and a half years through a stakeholder presidency open to those who will contribute and who are willing to develop what we are as a parliament to engage with me in an act of european imagination sometimes to elevate our gaze above introspection and look to the stars for some kind of european imagination and dream
we should therefore initiate a policy dialogue in important areas of economic management such as industrial policy the environment or competition
to dilute or alter it would be unacceptable and a move born out of political gerrymandering not a move in favour of maritime safety
the purvis report completely ignores the risks and endeavours to ensure that biotechnology serves the monopolies interests
that contributes to the depletion of stocks
the eu must continue doggedly to push through the condition that membership of the human rights council is based on an objective criterion and that requirements for membership are sufficiently strict
these changes known as variations relate for example to the manufacturing process the introduction of a new therapeutic indication updating of information leaflets or administrative changes
nowadays however the weapons that take most lives are light weapons
we must also of course prevent cases such as paragraph 71 introduced as a result of the ignorance and lack of knowledge of certain members of the socialist group in the european parliament who have mixed up two entirely different issues by failing to respect the art the traditions and the culture of other people who do not think in the same way as them and who are exemplary in terms of freedom and respect for diversity
if anyone seeks a sphere of influence it is russia as underlined by last summers war against georgia and the kremlins intermittent political destabilisation of countries such as ukraine and the baltic states
secondly i should like to thank all of the members of this chamber from north south east and west and from all political groups who have expressed specifically to us the portuguese socialists their solidarity with the victims of the drought and the fires currently ravaging the western iberian peninsula with portugal very much the worst affected region
if europes commitment to a social market economy is real we must integrate economic social and environmental policies as equal elements of the whole package
yet i regard it as being difficult nay impossible and i will come back to this point in a few moments to exclude decabde which is why in amendment no 4 in my report i call for a method for the evaluation of risks by family of chemical products and no longer on an individual substance by substance basis
a reinforced political dialogue with the country is ongoing as a followup to the article 96 cotonou agreement consultations which ended in april 2005
it has put political pressure on those countries that increase their deficits and for that reason it is of interest to us all irrespective of whether or not we have the euro or of whether or not we participate in monetary union
this means that the responsibility of fishermen is considerable and that producer groups in the fisheries sector deserve extra support in this
the fact is that the number of eu laws has risen dramatically in recent years and the eu is now legislating in a host of new areas
instead we should reconsider whether the resources particularly in terms of staff provided to the commission are adequate for the implementation of the policies we are seeking to promote
the unfortunate czech government crisis now leaves the commission and president barroso with enhanced responsibility to steer the community out of crisis providing for coherence and stability
i must also stress how necessary they are primarily as a factor in maintaining and consolidating stability in a region which has been hit hard and is in a delicate balance
the protest was vociferous
i would like to add a few words on the international convention on the protection of the alps
mugabe presides over a state that day in and day out subjects innocent zimbabweans to untold misery murder brutality and intimidation
i cannot agree with this decision given that there are other options for carbon dioxide capture in energy production processes for example the use of microalgae in water
we aimed again to halve that number by 2015 that means over 20 years a reduction of 22 million a year
the cuban government denies the existence of political prisoners and regrettably continues to reject international scrutiny of human rights from independent human rights organisations
it is true that this is a lifestyle choice and that people will eventually make their choice
as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on womens rights i should like to express our deep satisfaction with the comments and recommendations in the report on safeguarding and applying democracy and equality in daily life and practice in the sense of a balanced participation of the sexes in democratic institutions and respect for the human rights of women
yes the common agricultural policy is necessary but also the market is there and we should take much more advantage of it
instead we have to continue to tag along with our proposals and ideas
europe is in its most precarious economic situation since the end of the second world war
what a joke
mr nistic you said two things
it recalls the katy massacre the murder of thousands of polish officers held as prisoners of war in camps at ostaszkw starobielsko and kozielsko sentenced to death in march 1940 on the orders of lavrenty beria
as guard dogs they maintain a watch to ensure that the laws are implemented correctly in all corners of europe and in many cases they are the only ones to do this
failing this i fear that citizens and governments will not be prepared to invest in new or modern rails
firstly i should be interested to know which member states you have in mind
madam president the most surprising thing about our debate is our surprise for israels expansionist policy is the inevitable and predictable result of the growing imbalance in the region the stability for which we bear much of the responsibility
together they are attacking a legitimate government of a great and strongly proeuropean member state chosen and supported by 60 of italians
there are monitoring and identification systems for identifying the undertakings and livestock units which may have been contaminated
sooner or later all of them ended in failure
the most surprising thing is that the five candidates took up the same three themes
following the attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad and the attack on the sacred shiite sites in najaf the faint hopes of a lull that would make it possible to gradually legitimise the authorities established by the coalition are disappearing and with them the prospect of a more or less shortterm transfer of the coalitions current responsibilities
i am very grateful to you for your words mrs schreyer which show how interested the commission is today in the range of problems facing mountain regions we are quite aware of this
that is exactly why i thought it was indispensable for the commission to step in
we do not wish to see the social ills of people exploited but the eu has now destroyed even that with one of its own institutions the ecj where the rulings on laval and other cases ruined member states minimum wage policies
i would ask that this be communicated to the council and that it be urged to be more visibly and more frequently present in this house
six months will suffice in our view
i am not criticising germany or france
the global financial crisis has swept through europe and the accompanying economic shakeup once again severely affects the most vulnerable social groups and in particular the roma
we are assuming that will trigger a 14 to 15 growth in the entire european gnp
people are wondering if it is really necessary for us to have so much legislation so many institutions etc in addition i do not believe that the commission needs new institutions to supervise legislative acts and the revision of their drafts because we have a parliament which can fulfil this role perfectly well
i would like to say that we agree on the priorities as they have been expressed by your rapporteurs and as they have been expressed by mr bge and that it is in fact our wish to cooperate very closely
it is simply not appropriate to keep exercising the right to complain
we still have a lot of work to do to ensure that the last preparatory meeting in bali at the end of may produces results
the european union should move forward in matters of the single market and the economy if europe as an economic area wants to succeed in global competition and provide its citizens with jobs
no we did not
the european union should not delay in scrapping its export subsidies
i would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to article19 to the international federation of journalists reporters without borders the international league for human rights the danish organisations the helsinki committee from sweden and norway the centre of extreme journalism as it is called a russian organisation and the glasnost defence foundation
it is our duty to guarantee respect for the dignity of these professionals who moreover make a valuable highquality contribution to our work
and also the criteria of an imperial europe the kingpin of capitalist globalisation which intends to move within the wto towards specific liberalisation measures
my second point is that all countries need security legislation
it is constantly a question of striking this delicate and difficult balance between on the one hand exploiting the advantages of a new technique a new technology and new knowledge in this area and on the other preserving biological diversity and most importantly of all protecting peoples health
the difference between americans and europeans in terms of average income does not mean that europe is being left behind but rather reflects excessive increases in the incomes of the richest 20 in the united states
what we need is to have statesmen at the helm of our member states and not politicians who only live for the moment
the proper management of deepsea fish stocks is essential in order to promote the sustainability of the use of the seas and safeguard the conservation of marine ecosystems
mr president depending on the outcome of this vote i reserve the right to request the chairman of the committee to delete the explanatory statement in accordance with rule 161 of our rules of procedure
i can assure you that the council is firmly aware of the issues that are addressed in it and of the issues that have been raised here today
the commission can accept amendments 10 19 26 and 28 in principle
that means that an end will gradually be put to the distortion of competition affecting the internal market in this area
what measures does the commission envisage adopting with this in mind
a few months ago most of the political leaders quite simply denied the existence of echelon
it seems to me that our mission in this regard is both in washington dc and in strasbourg and brussels to create the playing field in which the lamys and zellecks or others depending on whether we are dealing with security and defence or whatever can actually play
no wonder the european union is so unpopular in my constituency of northeast england and elsewhere in europe
does the commission agree with this urgent conclusion
it is clear from these workshops that the present crisis is not just cyclical but structural
the development and freedom to act of independent pluralistic means of communication are extremely important in this work
ro mr president i would like to congratulate the rapporteur
this is one of the best examples of the european parliament s being able to make a difference and of its being able to perform a task which otherwise could not have been carried out because the individual parliaments would not have been up to the job it is also a good example of there being a common area of effective operation in europe that is of potential benefit to all citizens
as i said the review of the emissions trading directive will start at the beginning of 2005
i rejoice in the knowledge that the danish presidency has as one of its objectives a common position at the environmental council on 17 october following the conclusion of the first reading stage in plenary which is planned for the end of september
it amounts to feelgood therapy for the member states the union as a whole and also for this house
the conflict has claimed at least 400 000 lives and has been responsible for more than two and a half million displaced persons and refugees notwithstanding the signing of the peace agreement in darfur in 2006
so what has happened to the spirit of barcelona and the concept of an alliance of civilisations
does anyone wish to speak in favour of mr ribeiro e castro s motion
i have a suggestion to make to you
there can be no economically powerful society if there are serious inequalities and differences at its core and if its human potential is diminishing
it is a conundrum we must solve together
the next point consists of the council and commission statements on the return and resettlement of guantnamo inmates and the alleged use of european countries by the cia for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners
everyone stands to gain from this solution
the 2009 budget is also making a significant contribution to this solution
i also take this opportunity to offer a provocation to the presidentinoffice to bring citizens closer to the eu concrete signals must be sent out
however by supporting the amendments we would introduce greater consistency to legislative processes as we are now in the process of preparing the future legislation on discards to be applied to all community fleets
all in all its four pillars have passed the test
the pilot project is an excellent idea
finally the eu must get its act together and show that it has learned from the débâcle of recent weeks
i should like to inform you that i have received six motions for resolutions under rule 37 paragraph 2 of the rules of procedure
i also welcome the proposal for a prize to be awarded if a city meets the criteria for the european capital of culture as previous organisers have in many cases complained about a lack of resources as the european union allocated these only after the report had been submitted
the choice we expect from any other sophisticated personal equipment the competition we look for in the maintenance of our houses our computers and yes indeed our secondhand cars is condemned here
the european community does of course support the efforts being made by the organisation of african unity and by president wade within it
in addition to industrially advanced third countries there are also emerging economies which need to make concessions in proportion to their degree of development and their sectoral competitiveness
2
it also organised a range of technical meetings with the european parliament rapporteur in the desire to reach an agreement with the european parliament at first reading next month
however that is part of the job
mr president i would like to correct the entirely erroneous assumptions confusing this debate
would we be better off if the chinese or indian economy had not been developed
the commission for its part must defend the spirit and the letter of the treaties
that would surely be the best way to go about eradicating abuses such as traffic in human beings
some 450 amendments have been tabled around 180 of those amendments have now been included in this document and so there has been a substantial revision
i can confirm that some member states are in favour of creating such a database but others are reluctant and doubt the usefulness of such a database
in his absence i should like to thank mr laschet
the absence of any formal commission proposals and the rule of unanimity no doubt explain why the european council was incapable of looking after the interests of the european union and incapable of saying loudly and clearly that the interests of the union are best protected by multilateral action and that the rule of law is always preferable to the law of the strongest power
congestion then is one problem for which we undoubtedly need new and better technology
the commission supports the recommendations of the european committee for the prevention of torture as we set out quite clearly in the accession partnership
this is reflected in the brok report
rapporteur mr president in amendment 3 i have been told that there is some confusion over the french text
the commission is positive about the operation of our new delegation in havana
as indicated before the first priority is to promote a citizencentred approach by the eu institutions and bodies in all their activities
i need only remind you that most infringements of community law are only discovered as the result of the complaints system
i would like to distance myself from statements like that
in argentina i saw children suffering from hunger in the tucumn hospital in colombia i saw people killed there are thousands of deaths every year by paramilitaries and also by the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc with the complicity of the paramilitaries the justice system and the army but when i reached cuba i found that children were not hungry on the contrary infant mortality is amongst the lowest in the world there is culture there is education there are not thousands of deaths every year as there are in colombia and there is therefore an obvious contrast
we are still applying the macrofinancial aid system which can be applied to the candidate countries just as it is applied to any third country
from the point of view of the european free alliance which i particularly represent here there are however genuine concerns about the way in which the criteria are chosen the way in which one specifies what counts
langenhagen report a501292001
mr president after all these warm words i am going to put a cat among the pigeons
there is no doubt that this is an exceptional situation we do not know how to predict the budget for epizootics on this scale and we shall therefore have to make adjustments as we go along
i particularly appreciate your comments on the peace programme where the involvement of volunteering was indeed strong
that concludes question time
however in the context of a report such as mrs rodrguez ramos report on rural development in the world we must on no account forget that agriculture is an undertaking it is an economy and it needs a first pillar which allows europe to assume a strategic position on the major international commodities especially in the light of the decisions of the us government relating to the farm bill
the european union and india could also work more closely on promoting regional peace prosperity and stability
measures must therefore be taken to facilitate the conversion of these vessels for example by exempting them from having to pay back construction or modernisation aid obtained during the previous ten years and temporary tieup aid awarded under the financial instrument for fisheries guidance
as such the economically least developed countries would be penalised twice over
it has taken into account their opinions in particular those of private customers and charities by proposing that a reduced rate be applied to those services such as letterpost small packages and direct mail which such customers need most
democracy the rule of law and respect for human rights a sound economic policy gender equality and environmental aspects must be at the forefront of development
mr president in the rarefied atmosphere of this house it is very easy to lose touch with reality
gross national income in those countries grew almost twice as fast as the average for the euro area and the level of unemployment was lower
the community budget only provides research funding for gmes
i spent time first with a beautiful greek cypriot girl and then with a beautiful turkish cypriot girl
and it is up to us
i am not about to underestimate the problems those two countries are facing whether it be criminality corruption the judicial system or minorities be they roma or hungarians but we have to remember where those countries have come from
it is one that still requires unanimous agreement and i think it behoves us to stand up and say that the legal bases of the treaties do not allow the commission to come forward with a proposal for tax harmonisation
the next item is the debate on the report a503012002 by mr schmid on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs on the commissions communication to the council the european parliament the economic and social committee and the committee of the regions on the assessment of the first five years of the guidelines on employment 20022152ini
so we will be supporting amendments 1 2 6 18 and 19
energy labelling and standard product information recast debate
our experiences with the 2003 reform show that the decoupling has been working quite well and therefore i think we should move further and extend the benefits of decoupling except where coupled payments have a very solid justification
there is a strong need to consolidate the experience of a to g and involve industry not by force but by really involving them
i therefore have another question to put to both the commission and the council
at the scene of the crime indicated there are two possible victims but they say nothing
so i too very much welcomed the release of both ngawang sangdrol and jigme sangpo
finally the commission notes the attention parliament attaches to the issue of dealing with other recreational uses of waters such as surfing and sailing
these latest moves appear to be part of that pattern albeit aimed at a european audience this time
the stability and growth pact is the european political complement to the single currency and the single currency is our most important and successful response to globalisation
we are reminded that in the fight against terrorism our democracies must take care not to abuse civil liberties and human rights
it is a good feeling to see that europe is taking a leading role in the third industrial revolution
it is preparing a strategic communication on biotechnology to be completed by the end of 2001
in fact i am interested in whether the designated candidate for commissioner is listening to our discussion today as that would surely be justified in every possible respect
sl i would like to say a word about the planned commission measures which i read about in the media and which some constituents have also pointed out to me
the aim of the reach regulation is to guarantee high standards of health and environmental protection and boost the competitiveness of the eus chemicals industry through the use of high standards of safety and by promoting product development
we must enforce the integrated approach and speed up the implementation of the eu roma strategy
the previous speaker spoke in great depth about the sensitivity of water as an issue in every part of the world
i would reiterate here in this debate that is very important for us to defend passengers rights to defend citizens rights
we want closer involvement by europol in prosecuting cyber paedophiles and better cooperation between european law enforcement agencies
this is the best way to avoid excesses
the situation is so bad that some crew in the uk now are earning less than gbp 100 a week and that is driving hundreds of them to leave the industry at exactly the time that we need more young recruits joining the industry
the commission must take an objective position look at the letter of the treaty and not let itself be swayed by political considerations
if we are replacing or enhancing our legal system and access to justice these issues are key to civil society and they cannot and must not be tackled without the input of democratically elected members
i regard it as worrying that member states could use the indirect right of veto in the upr in connection with a debate on the situation in a country so that they fail to produce their countryspecific report
if this is not done i am afraid we will have to withhold direct payments under the common agricultural policy
not everything that calls for action in europe calls for action by europe but where europe is required to act europe must be strong
the recommendations also indicate the need to promote multidisciplinary education on patient safety at all levels of health worker education
that is why i supported the amendments that recommend extending filtering to nonlinear services that is the best way in future of preventing programmes justifying terrorism from being broadcast on european soil
with particular reference to two areas of european policy namely rural policy and forestry policy i should like to invite the commissioner to consider whether we can deploy these policy measures more effectively in those regions that are being hit by drought or other climaterelated disasters in the long term
i also want to thank the european commission for also having persisted with this issue by presenting a revised text which is fundamental given that it uses an instrument that is already available namely the capacity of local authorities to promote exemplary public procurement particularly in an area such as clean road transport vehicles which are now vital
although there is no doubt that some progress has been made the fact is that some questions still remain unanswered
get out of iraq says the says that the usa must wage war to the end the reports that iraq is falling apart before its occupiers eyes and that bush has announced that the money intended for security purposes is to be used now instead of for securing the peoples water supply
the commission informed the council that three of the eu15 member states had prior to 1 may 2009 notified the commission of serious labour market disruptions or the risk of such disruptions
every society every state with rule of law has a duty to pass judicial and administrative decisions and acts which safeguard the dignity and property of elderly people and the european union has a crossborder responsibility
i believe that it is more necessary than ever to reaffirm those principles of a community based on the rule of law that is our community
mrpresident the commissioner has already mentioned one of the problems
we are frequently told by representatives of the textile sector that with regard to some of these property rights such as design which is not as visible as others such as trademarks although countries have signed trips agreements within the world trade organisation they tend not to comply with them

we are also agreed about trying to reach an agreement on involving parliament in the cfsp arrangements within the framework of the treaty

de mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen everything that humans do to animals comes back to them pythagoras realised this as much as twoandahalfthousand years ago
it is also about taking action and action is what is completely missing from the report

there have been clear examples of this virtually every five years
on the two amendments the commission intends to agree with amendment 2 which aims at reducing the level of discards rather than introducing a complete ban across the board from the very outset
today my aim is not to provide you with an indepth analysis of the three principal documents that the madrid summit produced the presidency has already discussed this issue in detail

mr president ladies and gentlemen in the four weeks that have passed since my team was given your support we have rolled up our sleeves and set to work
today with climate change and melting glaciers other aspects such as environmental protection energy resources and human health are gaining priority
i would like to challenge this as for a democratically elected head of state it is not illegitimate to defend the economic interests and jobs of his fellow citizens
the council has no choice but to respect the commissions right to initiative
we are currently seeing this in one european union member state
in the united states too it has been openly admitted that 5 of all information the us collects for economic purposes originates from nonopen sources
it is up to the legislators to ensure that such people can work in an environment which is not detrimental to their rights
these are the civil liberties that we seek to protect with these proper balanced data retention rules that are in the proposals before parliament
this is a mistaken conclusion as far as i am concerned
that way we will achieve a far greater effect and greater savings while also protecting the environment and the climate
well then during this very enjoyable event i wondered to myself how i should vote on mr lamassoures important report on competences
nevertheless it is because it is sensitive to the political situation that the commission has agreed to delay implementation of this graduation

as the questioners are not present questions 22 and 23 lapse
this idea is firstly that war is certainly no way to resolve the worlds problems
the documents and specifically the legal advice from the councils own legal service must be made public and not just in a small room only accessible to meps since we have already found them next to the photocopier we already know what they say but for the citizens of europe
to a great extent these initiatives have had a positive effect
it is not in any case because an association agreement would give a government or a country some kind of carte blanche to do whatever it likes
i would now like to focus on two points that are perhaps more politically controversial the power of public and state authorities to have access to european union citizens personal data and unsolicited commercial email
i am very glad that the committee decided to launch a european initiative to continue to promote a ban on smoking in restaurants cafes and pubs and public buildings
mr president my group the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left has demanded the closure of the us prison camp in guantnamo right from the start
we welcome the support given by that parliament to the commissions approach to building a more effective partnership with the united nations

rapporteur da mr president i believe that in ten to twenty years time europeans will be environmentally aware in a quite different way than at present
will the result help to overcome the crisis
the purpose of the definition is indeed to prevent airlines with shares in a crs abusing their position
i share this ambition
the proposals that we make in this regard are both credible and ambitious

people across europe are becoming increasingly worried about the safety of consumer products such as childrens toys
i will give you one example of this
during compromise negotiations certain specific concerns of some member states were recognised allowing for the production of a strong and widely supported proposal
it is absurd that a quarter of the seats in parliament will go to the military
however the simplification of procedures does not mean lowering quality or having fewer controls
although the developments in iraq have given us cause for concern it is of the utmost importance that the european union should support the iraqi people in the coming months and that we should not abandon but should in fact keep providing them with support

finally i would like to point to the importance of promoting renewable energy sources and clean forms of transport and say that it is urgent that we discuss seriously the issue of nuclear energy once and for all

we could need about 459 new offices in brussels alone
we have therefore tried to simplify things by giving a kind of admissibility incentive
i refer to the worrying mckinsey analysis of the matter
unless there is a framework for taking older aircraft out of service we will never have the degree of control we need
here in the house i do not need to enlarge on this task for it is one with which every one of you has to do on a daily basis and i am sure that we all agree that communication can be improved and needs to be one of our principal priorities
i was in my electoral district this morning and when i opened the newspapers i learned that you are to receive the international charlemagne prize in aachen next year
mr president freedom of expression and an independent media are the cornerstone of democracy and they have to be valued highly and protected
however despite a significant fall in the price of crude oil in some countries high prices are being maintained and the victims are the consumers
the level of investment will also be one of the relevant criteria in deciding whether to issue an opinion or not
if you consider the speed at which a list of email addresses could be circulated online and come to the attention of an unlimited number of people interested in sending unsolicited messages and if you consider the cost in time and money of eliminating these unwelcome messages and sending requests to the various senders to stop forwarding them you will have an idea of the burden on citizens of adopting the optout system
the truth is also as we need to acknowledge that the classification leaves a lot to be desired because deep water species are considered to be all those living at a depth greater than 400 metres this merging together a wide range of species that do not have any biological zonal or morphological characteristics in common
if only this will presidentinoffice could be the subject of a broad consensus in the council
thousands of migrants many of them pregnant women and young children have died in this way in recent years
due to the financial crisis we are clearly facing delays in a lot of energy and capitalintensive projects
in writing pt the aviation agreement with morocco is the second agreement relating to the socalled common european airspace and the first concluded in this context with a country outside the continent of europe
does this though sufficiently highlight the context in which we have to operate
since the competent services are still heavily involved in the research the honourable member will undoubtedly agree that the council is not the appropriate body to deal with this question
to rectify this situation the greens the liberals and the left group have jointly tabled amendment no 48 to emphasise the general principle that the information should be free of charge
the memorandum of understanding sets out a number of principles and requires signatories to work towards implementation through selfregulation at national level
it should be pointed out that there are obviously some clans and some tribes that still carry on this practice and it is quite a sensitive subject in the country but he really had a desire to make progress and that i believe is important
we have a number of important things to do and i along with many others am waiting for the commission to take the initiative
i will just repeat that the tobacco reform was agreed by all tobaccoproducing countries in 2004 so therefore i see no reason to reopen this discussion
issues such as continuing high levels of unemployment in some of the member states tackling poverty combating discrimination on grounds of disability promoting active ageing and providing childcare facilities are all important and need to be dealt with as priorities
there are certain recommendations in mr lauks report that i would like to stress and i shall add a few of my own
we cannot however view the association agreement from a purely economic perspective the importance of the political dimension of the agreement needs to be stressed
secondly the control of the eus external borders and the fight against networks of illegal immigrant smugglers will unfortunately remain a political priority for many years to come because in reality the trade in human misery is in the hands of criminal gangs
europe without the concept of solidarity is not really a european union
i support the councils position and the ecb president mr trichet in the comments he has made
that alone can scarcely fail to make it clear the need for cooperation in this area
this incident happened outside the echo offices in the pera district
that concludes the vote
in the days following the elections the negative trend in the political climate in belarus has persisted
i therefore applaud the amendment by the group of the greens designed to place an immediate ban on the entire group of brominated flame retardants right now
there have always been migrations
their high costs which even now mean that the safest cars are luxury cars for many people and the lack of dissemination and awarenessraising campaigns on their benefits prevent greater market penetration
i am aware that there is a great deal more that i could say but i can assure you that what mrs wallstrm did say in the february partsession is that the european union will never fund and will never agree with any plan that does not respect the environment
because what we have here is duplicate legislation we are creating legal uncertainty
on the extreme left and among certain wellknown antieuropeans the bolkestein directive had become an obvious bogeyman the symbol of an antisocial europe
it was the application of a repressive policy like this which led to the authorities of a member state prosecuting seven tunisian fishermen for having saved 44 people at sea despite this action complying with international maritime law
nonetheless the negotiation which is basically starting today with the very realistic approach taken by mr bge should confirm three basic preconditions which are pivotal to europe
we have our doubts
between 1990 and 2000 the countries of the european union reduced global mercury emissions by 60
also the political budgetary and technical aspects will all need to be weighed in order for the activities to be planned well and the eu should therefore also be certain that it can actually deliver
however the appeasers in this house might like to explain why they embraced a war in kosovo that involved no weapons of mass destruction or threats to neighbouring states and that had no un authority whatsoever and yet find it so difficult to take action against a genocidal dictator who has started two wars responsible for the deaths of almost a million people and who has gassed his own people
as far as my own group is concerned we have tabled a series of amendments which seek to undo some of the potential damage
article 23 therefore reflects chinese communist paranoia both past and present
i am grateful to mrrack for stressing this point
i understand the differences in approach between the member states
in fact 30 have no intention of participating in the forthcoming elections

mr martinez you see i have not cut short anyones speaking time this afternoon
i mentioned the issue of the 5 million to illustrate that i do not fully agree with your comparison of the figures
it also ignores the plans that are forging ahead on the enfopol interception system in the eu
that is our question
food prices in europe short presentation
other than that i have nothing more to add perhaps i may just add a brief comment regarding a point that was mentioned earlier namely the different access rights granted to eurojust and europol
this also applies to the situation in the developing countries
what is really required in the long term is of course legal immigration in the european union from that point of view the council has missed an opportunity by deliberately excluding legal immigration from qualified majority voting
we would also like the commission to study and please note that i am saying study we are not talking about a proposal as such the scope for introducing a tax on bottled mineral water in the eu countries and in the relevant acp countries a very low tax about half a euro cent which would make an important contribution to the fund
it is tragic that so few member states have made use of these and personally i would be in favour of legislating in this regard
mr president i much regret that the committee on industry external trade research and energy did not deliver an opinion on this subject
it is not our job in these circumstances to stand and watch
the region is one of the most multicultural regions in the uk and is proving that its competitive advantage in cultural diversity is becoming a source of creativity and innovation
the message should be that it makes a difference whether you carry out reforms or not
we shall continue to work on this question taking as our basis the wto agreement on health and plant health
the feigned indignation of all those who here are protesting against the violence of mugabe s regime seems in these circumstances to be above all a hypocritical way of defending a handful of privileged people against the right to live of millions of farmers in that country
we have difficulties there but i am sure that they are less than with the present optout regime
they must appreciate the consequences of having a fixed exchange rate and of not being able to conduct their own monetary policy
this needs to be a programme to support proeuropean forces prodemocratic forces and democratic processes in ukraine
member states will have to establish marineprotected areas to meet their objectives under this directive in accordance with the international commitments of the community and the member states
this is not an isolated phenomenon but is something that can be seen happening along practically the entire coastline of europe and as a result of this situation commissioner borg to whom i pay tribute has been moved to propose the integrated maritime policy which should enable us to restore preserve and resurrect the communities that live around the coasts of europe
the commission should give priority to regulations for the simple reason that regulations are directly applicable as law and have a direct effect on those members of the public who have recourse to law
the iraqis are just like us they share the same desire for freedom and for a settled society
they are wrong the price they have to pay for growing international isolation and possible sanctions will increase dramatically
if we want to generate growth and therefore employment we obviously need to strengthen our economic budgetary and industrial coordination at least within the eurozone
it is how we have shaped our enlargement process by setting a goal and then providing support both financial and political for the stages along this road to enlargement
the resolution we are to vote on today in the european parliament contains many references to cases that must be unequivocally condemned
if half or onethird of what he wrote is true then sinn féinira has a serious problem about controlling what is happening in the communities it says it represents
i certainly believe we can improve the situation i believe this can be achieved and i believe it can be done by targeting particular areas which we consider to be the most vulnerable
are they partners imposed on us
that being said i am going to focus my speech on north korea i could not care less about whether it has nuclear technology that is genuinely fullydeveloped or an appropriate vehicle for such technology
it is entirely clear to me now although if i may be so bold i am a little less clear about for whom the question is intended
what europe must do however is to facilitate the evolution of lisbon and many things are needed and indeed possible in order to do this
obviously when one chooses to be the president of a country and has the responsibility of the presidency of the union for six months if one does not like problems or difficulties it is better not to be european and not to be involved in politics
the need for better lawmaking and for laying down better rules is the subject of a genuine consensus
but the greek government is stuck inside the euro straitjacket
the vote is concluded
since the last financial perspectives the eu has undertaken the biggest enlargement in its history and has become even more integrated with the entry into force of the treaty of nice and the signing of the constitutional treaty
however since the code of conduct was introduced the market for the sale of air tickets has changed considerably as alternative sales channels have developed
the future lies in local production and short distances for animal transport as well as in consumer protection with animals reared in natural conditions
there is no doubt that agriculture is very important to the countryside but there are also many other businesses out there
in fact as regards the commissions priorities for action in 2007 we feel that there is a lack of drive by the commission to ensure that a practical common policy on immigration is launched
the latter has accepted putting an end to mercury exports from 1 july 2011 and i believe that these agreements must be respected and under no circumstances must the date for banning mercury exports be brought forward
your responses to these three points will certainly be followed very closely
measures must be taken to make these procedures more flexible
furthermore this document is consistent with various other regulations and documents which this parliament has declared itself in favour of
the first would come at the end of recital e and would be to add as well as the bamako declaration made by 52 member states of the organisation of african unity on light weapons and small arms
the purpose of the mission is to guarantee the security of the civilian population but unfortunately there is evidence that the force is being used as a pawn in the internal game in chad
unfortunately in many cases little attention is devoted to our fundamental freedoms and rights as citizens
fr the fact that we are meeting to debate climate change at exactly the same time as international experts are meeting in paris to discuss climate change and the consequences thereof sends out a strong message
i believe that in the field of public services we must be able to continue to finance what is not profitable with what is and therefore that it is necessary to balance out prices
i feel at least as much pride in having helped put a stop to some of the nonsense and i hope that more members of this house following tomorrows
other regions in the world are already far ahead of us when it comes to the vision of what should be done next
as i said earlier this evening i cannot accept amendments nos 5 or 21 because they introduce the optional arrangements which the commission rejects
the basic principle as far as i am concerned however is that farmers and growers rights must be preserved
bg mr president ladies and gentlemen at the moment there is a danger hanging over bulgarian society
one last word mr president this weekend in front of your european guests the president of parliament the president of the commission and in front of 2 000 french rightwing business executives you concluded your speech with words which were interpreted by the trade union movement in its entirety as an incitement and a very unwise one by stating that now when there is a strike the french people no longer even notice
i lay such weight on that in view of the past political campaign waged by many members of this house with the objective of getting parliament to set up a committee of inquiry
it is really high time the european union returned to the issue of tobacco as silence has surrounded the subject for too long
the focus on these elements should be enhanced
the economic recovery package we will vote on is in reality a nonrecovery plan which will produce almost no immediate economic stimulus
a power struggle is going on uninhibited by any sense of decency and parliamentary democracy is being given no chance to develop seriously
ladies and gentlemen of the commission we who talk more to the people who live alongside us eat and drink with us and pay us taxes cannot afford that for the future
that is the platform where it should happen but it is precisely this kind of international trade problem linked to a real international legal problem of 260 million people that calls for a common approach not only in india but also in other countries
the fact is however that this is not quite the case in terms either of the conventions procedures or of its membership
like others i regret that we do not have a resolution in front of us in which we could have expressed our complete condemnation of police brutality and of the violence of the black block at genoa our conviction that those responsible must be brought to justice our commitment to uphold the right to protest peacefully and our determination to clarify the growing evidence that much of the violence and damage to property which occurred in genoa was the work of agents provocateurs
we should also not forget the windstorms that left a trail of destruction in the baltic states and sweden in january of this year
b505932001 by mr garot and mr adam on behalf of the pse group on footandmouth disease
checking the statute of the prize i found that it can be awarded for particular achievement in any of four fields defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms safeguarding the rights of minorities respect for international law and the development of democracy and the implementation of the rule of law by my reckoning that means we should today be awarding the prize four times over
but at the same time we will continue our work on analysing what impact speculation has at a particular moment and whether there is really the ability to diminish volatility and have more supervision in the energy market
more than half of the population in the world gets less than two dollars per day
we intend to promote strategic dialogues ranging from regulatory dialogue to cooperation in research in sectors such as information technology transport energy biotechnology or space science

we all support freedom of speech freedom of worship freedom of assembly and so on
it considers that the un should take centre stage in achieving this objective with the european union playing an enhanced role within it
even today people can survive them by means of the transplantation of bone marrow heart valves and skin and the new biotechnological discipline of tissue engineering will certainly lead to new triumphs in the future
the structure of this package is simple it is a virtuous circle in which each link in the transport chain from the port state to the insurer via the charterer the classification society and the flag state is responsible for its own actions and in some way applies pressure or at least that is what we are betting on to clean up transport conditions and to ensure that they are using a responsible transporter that complies with the standards
allow me to say that if everything were going well my appearance before the european parliament would not necessarily have gone better because a year from the elections when you have the wind behind you and everything is going well everyone is thinking of their partisan or national interests
the current legislation which is nearly 30 years old urgently needs updating
i share the view of commissioner ferrerowaldner who said that the council had been in existence for a year that we had imagined everything would be different but that we should not make snap judgments about the council
i look forward to the day when europe rejoices as much in diversity within states as it does in diversity between them
to this day nature and the environment are under more serious threat there than in other parts of europe because motorways are built and minerals extracted in the cheapest ways possible
the second report mr president ladies and gentlemen deals with a different matter altogether
parliament has the power to deliver for citizens and the internal market committee was determined to go for a strong ban whilst securing exemption for traditional inuit hunting
the reforms that europe needs must not however be seen as a task for the commission alone
in the year 2000 when the european council met in lisbon we were promised that the european economy would become the most competitive in the world by 2010
unfortunately mr almunia is absent because if he were listening now he would hear that in 2005 and 2006 instead of taking into account market projections like those of goldman sachs and standard amp poors the governments misleading remarks were heeded instead
the aims of this package which mr watson has proposed range from harmonisation of laws and regulations to improvement of judicial assistance from the creation of a european search and arrest warrant to provision for the compensation of victims and the member states of the european union should not only use it to combat the familiar forms of terrorism but should also apply it against the new forms of terror to which we were introduced at the last summit meeting and which i fear will resurface at similar events in the future
mr president liberal democrats in this house join the tributes which have been paid to sergio vieira de mello and all the other victims of the callous attacks on the united nations in baghdad
we can love our homeland and at the same time defend our european project with conviction as president sarkozy said just now
clear information on flight ticket pricing is a particularly important issue
however this requires a total break with big shipping business a break that the eu cannot and does not want
i should like to start with mr goepels report
mr president on behalf of the socialist group i would welcome this report and the work done in particular by the rapporteur and all the others concerned to reach a first reading agreement and therefore hasten the implementation of this proposal
we try to keep a balance so that we do not have the same members speaking on all the reports because the clock is ticking
i am thinking here of the solarhydrogen economy which would be a real challenge for this continent and even for the international community
on behalf of the alde group fr madam president commissioners ladies and gentlemen there is a time for words and there is a time for action
there are many reasons for proper financing but i would like to mention just one
as mrs stihler said the eu charter of human rights demands that no financial gain shall be made from parts of the human body as such
it must be based on solidarity between rightholders and on an appropriate fair balance among management societies
the icc is the most competent international criminal tribunal which can make the many notorious perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity accountable for their actions
i have to inform you properly of the procedural consequences
if so may i call on you madam president to ask the council or mr solana to issue a statement making it absolutely clear that this was an exception and that the visa ban and the common position are still in place
thirdly introducing additional regulations concerning economic and social processes when what is actually required is a drastic reduction of such measures
the iranian judiciary had decided to suspend the use of stoning as a means of execution
i hope that the member states affected will soon be in a position to give brussels a report on what the damage amounts to and enable the commission to make funds promptly available for the speedy rebuilding of public facilities for that is the major problem where i come from and to help build up protective infrastructure
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the compiling of integrated guidelines at threeyearly intervals will tend to improve the coordination of national economic policies
where there is equal merit systematic preference must be given to women when filling management posts until a balance is achieved
these are key initiatives that not only provide work for europes valuable and highly skilled scientists but also prepare the eu to face future challenges as a global leader
with regard to adjustment to the midterm objective the member states that are not yet in a situation of mediumterm balance are generally fulfilling the requirement to make a budgetary effort at least equivalent to 05 of their gdp in structural terms
applause
six minors have been executed in iran so far this year that brings the total since 2005 to 26
madam president nowadays when the subject of climate change crops up it is usually described as global warming
mr president i should like to thank you very much commissioner monti for the courage and the will you have shown in tabling this proposal
while we are talking about this strategic work programme perhaps i might say something else to the president of the commission about his new commission for the commission sitting here is an old one to be joined by two new commissioners
mr president commissioners mr presidentinoffice of the council let me also on behalf of my group in this new sort of debate not indeed the only one as we will be having another in october on the substantive votes set before you our position our approach and our concerns
es the remainder of the text would remain the same
i have experienced war in bosnia and i know that it is extremely easy to start a war and extremely difficult to bring it to an end
we have also worked together within the framework of the eu s northern dimension initiative
not everyone in europe is in favour of such flexibility as is obvious from events taking place on the streets of paris
the doubt expressed by a number of honourable members as to the extent to which it fosters competitiveness is i think somewhat exaggerated given that if nothing else the employment strategy has resulted in what are also businessfriendly job market reforms
it is you who have the contact with the public
the employees must have certain opportunities to act in situations such as these
we foresee the eu combating social exclusion and discrimination promoting equality between women and men which is a crucial point in our documents and protecting the rights of children
nevertheless in this area in particular action will speak louder than words
this has been our common conviction since the crisis began last year
we are also concerned about our regions their villages and towns
i have been here for 22 years
as i do not know whether i will again have the honour to speak when you are in the chair i would like to thank you for exercising the office of vicepresident in such an outstanding way
i want to warmly thank all my fellow members for their proposals especially the shadow rapporteurs the pse secretariat and the committee on industry research and energy because with their help we have managed i believe to strengthen the directive on energy labelling
communication of council common positions see minutes
this makes it hard to see on what basis the structural funds fall under this regulation
let me mention some of these by way of example the reach regulation the regulation on persistent organic pollutants the mining waste directive and the restrictions on use of substances under the pesticides directive and the directive on restriction of the circulation and use of certain hazardous substances

some countries such as sweden and ireland have imposed a strict ban on smoking in restaurants cafes and pubs and in public buildings others have provided for narrow exemptions
i also agree fully with mr swoboda who is no longer here not because of the austrohungarian monarchy but because he is right namely in that it is decided at local level whether or not something will succeed
furthermore and in this approach of genuine subsidiarity a while ago i advocated in this house the creation of a committee on subsidiarity in the european parliament to improve our
mr president the abolition in october 2000 of the main opposition party in mauritania the union of democratic forcesnew era and the arrest and subsequent sentencing to five years imprisonment after a summary judgment of the leader of the popular front chbih melainine calls into question the fundamental principles of democracy laid down in the constitution of mauritania
in denmark the supply of water services is decentralised primarily public and to a lesser extent private but it is always userowner controlled
fava report a500602001
in writing i welcome this report which in essence calls for a firm policy to fight illegal immigration based on solidarity between member states and cooperation with third countries in full respect of the fundamental rights of the person
it is also in that context that the european union is active
the commissioner mentioned the essential sector of textiles for developing countries
however once again i feel obliged to express two reservations in this regard
in the end this will also produce a fairer pension system
this applies especially to the countries at the heart of europe
although matters related to climate change were discussed at the summit it can be seen in practice that the crisis which has hit us is marginalising that extremely expensive pseudoscientific project
this will be achieved with the second generation schengen information system the vis the operation of frontex broader use of biometric data and the creation of central databases
my question is therefore would the commission agree with adopting a european charter to recognise the defence of the rights of the victims of terrorism and to promote those rights
products that are made in a less clean way outside the eu gain a competitive edge in global markets
of course we are familiar with reports which tell us that the recent reduction in the number of death sentences has not reduced the countrys crime rate
the daphne projects have enabled us to implement community training and support programmes to carry out awareness campaigns to analyse national legislation to gather information and statistics to develop tools and to establish best practices for use by the actors on the ground and to recommend policy directions to european and national decision makers
while we all agree that certain urgent shortterm measures need to be taken at eu and member state level to alleviate the plight of fishermen skippers and their crews such as appropriate levels of state aid perhaps reduction in tax on fuel over a certain price financial support for tyingup and greater control of imports garnered from illegal fishing to name but a few options we as policymakers must also look to the future
therefore whilst we are not opposed to the draft text we did not wish to give it our backing and we abstained from the vote
we all know that the new rules adopted by parliament on the situation of parliamentary assistants are nothing more than internal regulations
how long will it be before we read the memoirs of some us president or highranking british officer and see how much political capital they made from echelon and how big a laugh they had at our expense
now tony blair far from leading a national debate on the benefits of europe is conniving disgracefully in a dangerous and populist attack by conservatives and the media on the european convention on human rights
most of the wish lists i have seen and heard so far are not as short as that but for all those who wrote them they are expressions of hope

nuclear proliferation is more or less under control although we have been going through a very difficult phase since the signing of the nonproliferation treaty in 1968 which then came into force in 1970

indeed the council was unable to reach agreement on a compromise package and it did not if the truth be known seem to me to be particularly interested in achieving such an agreement with parliament

this is also an area in which i believe parliament should take action
on the particular issue of security of citizens justice and migration the eplp supports the general position of the ep as well as the other institutions in the development of policy in this important field
for example coverage of mountain and island areas entails more difficulties than coverage of plains

i personally believe that the steps taken recently to eliminate the negative impact of earthquakes are the correct ones
pl mr president referring back to two speeches by my fellow members i would like to comment on the elections in russia

it mr president ladies and gentlemen i would venture to suggest that one cannot possibly say how to curb rising energy prices in just over one minute

my group has never argued in favour of a rash increase in the unions budget
first of all the involvement of local regional authorities and nongovernmental organisations is less than satisfactory
i strongly support the notion that citizens who wish to take up temporary residency outside their home country should be allowed to bring their personal motor vehicle without running into financial and administrative obstacles
nevertheless we can clearly see the need to fully implement the existing legal framework and to ensure that this is respected while fleshing it out and adapting it to new realities
the czech presidency at its halfway point can state with certainty that its second half will be just as good as the first and just as responsible and in the end we will undoubtedly be celebrating the same successes as you have spoken of here today in the context of assessing the work of january february and march
well my task was to produce an owninitiative report firmly anchored to the first pillar
i am fully in support of that
the work programme lamentably perpetuates this general trend
we must take care to avoid this

the assistance took the form of intervention teams highly specialised material and financial support
an attempt is being made to lay aside the social political and democratic crisis and the significance of the french referendum and to do so by focusing solely on the intergovernmental method which has even prevented parliaments including myself for example from being privy to the berlin declaration and on continuing with the old liberalist treaty perhaps eager to create a minimalist version of it
whether that actually is the case i do not propose to consider but people feel that social rights are being reduced that social options are being cut back and that there are also not enough jobs for people to earn enough money and amass sufficient financial resources to keep themselves and their families
furthermore there are reports of political pressure against voters coercing them to take part in rallies and campaign events
b502072001 by mrs mckenna and others on behalf of the group of the greenseuropean free alliance on the situation in the indonesian province of central kalimantan

in france labels now carry a warning against alcohol consumption by pregnant women
and in view of this comparison i do not believe that what we are going to approve today improves on what on that previous occasion had been proposed at least by the european parliament
it is all well and good to affirm a priority but this priority must also be followed up by concrete action
the number of death sentences last year which the commissioner also referred to is a tragic illustration of this
as a result hundreds of the airlines passengers were denied not only the opportunity of making the journeys they had planned but above all they were exposed to significant financial losses caused by the airlines collapse
i also hope that the traffic lightstyle labelling to which consideration is still being given is no more than a witless joke
now the foreign troops are preparing to withdraw from iraq
one thing is quite clear the plenary and the groups are the masters of events

let us resist that temptation
this will therefore need to be examined more closely
as a result of the economic crisis unemployment levels are rising in europe and this is seriously affecting the european economy
i do not wish to underestimate the role of the european institutions as they can add considerable value such as in the area of liberalising gas and electricity but renewable energy production should remain a national issue since it is in the member states that the majority of these issues have for a long time now been understood
rightly or wrongly this integration is linked to an excessively liberal policy on asylum
let me say turning to the financial perspectives that the 1 does of course make them impossible

while i welcome the adoption of good internal practices i also believe that it is essential for small and mediumsized enterprises to be suitably protected above all in the area of international trade particularly in connection with markets that exploit unfair competition and often do not reject practices that damage workers rights and at times even violate childrens rights to childhood
mr president ladies and gentlemen in our work we need to keep a clear vision of the path the union must continue to follow peace freedom and solidarity must continue to be our goals in the daytoday work of the institutions
the last commission legitimised this move however by initiating and financing pilot projects
a derogation will also allow member states to retain national laws relating to their reception capacity when examining applications for family reunification

on 19 july 2007 an agreement was signed between mr tiefensee the german minister for transport and the authorities in the federal state of badewurtemberg the region and city of stuttgart and deutsche bahn
this is a major health and environmental problem because many users replaced the high brominated flame retardants in products with low brominated ones and the use of low brominated flame retardants such as decabdes accounts for 80 per cent of all flame retardants

all that worries me is the demand by the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe for a split vote a split vote would threaten to undermine important parts of this otherwise excellent report
de thank you mr president
the message which europe is sending today is in my opinion loud and clear
we said that we could not agree to what had been decided by the heads of state or government but that we instead wanted to do something to bring together young people in particular
physical force is used as a big stick
this introduces a reduction in the number of journeys with empty goods vehicles a higher level of professional training for drivers rationalisation of the market raising the quality of services and in this way also an indirect influence in increasing road safety
such situations represent the genuine expression of a concrete solidarity between the people of the european union
i am therefore pleased that at least now at the third attempt the proposal presented by the commission is based on a sound approach and we support it not least because it incorporates many of our parliamentary proposals particularly those made by the group of the european peoples party christian democrats and european democrats
we carried out 22 studies on these regions
that he should not be so is unbelievable
mr president i would like to draw the attention of the house to a major industrial dispute in my constituency of london which affected many thousands of air passengers around europe that of the gate gourmet workers 670 of whom were arbitrarily dismissed from their jobs on 13 august without any redundancy payment
it is a telling fact that a country such as the united kingdom should be backing turkeys accession all the way while at the same time refusing to budge on its rebate

mr president the culture education and information element of the budget accounts for barely half of 1 of the eu budget compared with 50 of the budget that goes on agriculture
mr president the british conservatives do not believe that the commissions proposal should be diluted postponed or reviewed
the european union would therefore ask all countries of the western balkans to cooperate with the icty as a token of their willingness to meet their international obligations and respect the principle of rule of law the latter being one of the cornerstones on which the union is founded in accordance with article 6 of the treaty on european union
the idea in fact is to make european citizens more aware of the reality of terrorism to prevent terrorism
i think that slowly and gradually we are getting there
the precautionary principle must be the guiding principle there is no other way
we need to end impunity where it exists outside the european union where we have influence but more importantly within the european union and in this case in a community in northern ireland
i also clearly noticed your concern which i share that this informal meeting should able to specify timetables and to see who is in the best position to address each national situation
transparency is i believe the key to european democracy and its main building block
the report we are now debating warrants our support particularly because it advocates the approximation and harmonisation of the legislation of the fifteen member states
finally and again very significantly i would like to note and here i undoubtedly go beyond the words of the resolution which urges the government of sudan to follow the demands of the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court luis morenoocampo to arrest ahmed haroun sudans minister of humanitarian affairs specifically so that he can be held accountable for the displacement of two million people in darfur thereby instigating an international trial which should have begun some time ago
the next item is the report a501442002 by mr konrad on behalf of the economic and monetary affairs committee on the draft commission regulation on the application of article 813 of the treaty to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices in the vehicle industry
i am therefore pleased that we can set a good example with the various funds in the european union
as someone who focuses on agricultural and rural issues i heartily welcome this initiative
based on that preliminary examination and the documents submitted at this stage by the greek authorities the commission is still unable to adopt a position on the nature of these decisions under eu rules on state aid

in it he emphasises how petitions allow the citizens to make their legitimate aspirations known and also draw attention to the inherent weaknesses of community legislation the commission is interested in your work on both these counts ladies and gentlemen

consumers have the power to determine whether to boost and support those farmers in europe to whom animal protection keeping animals in conditions appropriate to their species and healthy foodstuffs are important or whether to force our farmers to participate in global dumping with rockbottom standards and prices
that in brief is my point of view but i hope like you and like parliament though i will listen to you closely that things will move forwards
we all know the answer to these questions
the 2010 budget earmarks eur 25 million for microfinance and against the advice of the council allows the draft budget relating to cohesion fund interventions to be kept
the result was to damage the enlargement process and introduce unexpected hurdles when we all believed a solution was within our grasp an unprecedented dispute then arose because precedents were ignored
as regards collaboration between the public and private sectors in the field of security as proposed the question which arises is who will exercise control of the honest function of private individuals and how
it is now very much up to the commission to present a plan a strategy with specific goals and measures
could they not have seen it coming
de mr president the big european vision has unfortunately made brussels deaf and blind to numerous undesirable developments in the eu
it is not acceptable that authorities and other state bodies should interfere in elections at various levels and in all manner of different ways
in the course of the deliberations departure from the idea of liberalisation in favour of a gradual rather cautious opening of the postal market for letters weighing less than 50 grammes became increasingly apparent this is reflected in the compromise date for the entry into force of the directive specifically in the case of new member states and countries with small populations small geographical areas and public service clauses
we believe that the report improves on some substantial aspects of the commissions proposal in proposing the partial decoupling of aid and the retention of aid for producers organisations
we cannot stop that work now and say that we will just wait for a constitution
health research is not only worthwhile in its own right it is also worthwhile in relation to its economic merits especially research on respiratory health which is currently lacking from the programme
it set out a series of key actions which add up to a major programme of action and it agreed how and why we should take the next steps towards an institutional settlement
why does he not dare ask his own austrian people what they think of the constitution
we cannot stand back and do nothing about this discrepancy which many believe manifests itself in the crisis of confidence that we are currently experiencing
whilst you were speaking indeed whilst mrs gurmai was summing up her report i noticed that there were members of the public coming into the visitors gallery
this in turn would increase public opposition to the eu
of course the same applies to the horrifying acts of terrorism for which i have no sympathies whatsoever
the future of europe depends on minorities
subsequent developments in iraq in particular have demonstrated that things are never simple and the current situation can be described by means of the lyrics of a spanish song which say neither with you nor without you is there any relief for my pain
therefore europeans money would be put to good use it would promote development and not just increase the return on capital invested
we could make transport more sustainable at subsequent stages too by issuing green invitations to tender as is being suggested in the proposal we are discussing at the moment
we do not expect ethiopian democratic norms to be of a european standard
our problems are the disintegration of society and environmental pollution problems that will not be solved by ever increasing economic growth at any price
a great many eu vessels and jobs relied upon it primarily in spain but also in portugal

moreover the european union will still be open to all those europeans who accept its values
france the czech republic and sweden have together prepared an 18month presidency programme and i am pleased that this prioritises the issue of energy which is absolutely key and also the issue of reforming the common agricultural policy because this relates to the financial framework after 2013 and thus to what money is going to be available to us in the future
i am pleased that parliament in its negotiations with the council has managed to carry out a number of important improvements in the proposed programme the most important of which is a substantial reduction in the thresholds for awarding support which in many cases have been reduced by half for in practice it still proves difficult for small enterprises to use this programme
it is something anybody can try
we complied and the assistants themselves acknowledge that they are prepared to relinquish any reference to taxation as long as they get a proper statute
we also believe it to be very important for common rules governing liability for damage to be drawn up at international level
we have a situation here in which the industry stands on one side the consumers whose rights we are strengthening stand on the other with the dealers sandwiched in between
it is high time for the european union to launch legislation on the definition investigation and penalisation of ecrime
now the eu must rally around our values of freedom and united actively support the forces that wish to build a new iraq a sovereign and democratic country that takes its place in the international community
szjer report
that treaty has been rejected

the leaders of the movement belong to fanatical extremist organisations that do not hesitate to play with the lives of their militants or even their families for political propaganda purposes
pl madam president commissioner you did not need to take such a defensive position
on the one hand we will have to accept certain changes in the interests of combating poverty in the poorest countries while at the same time we are not allowed to be too generous in the unilateral concessions we make
i understand the despair the rage the humiliation the collective punishments the retaliation the need of the palestinians forced to live under military occupation for 30 years for freedom i understand the historical fear of the israeli people the persecutions they have suffered the unique experience of the shoah for which we europeans are responsible i understand the fear that a bomb might explode under a bus or a shell hit a school but these fears do not give anyone the right to occupy another peoples territory or to violate international human rights
let us be absolutely clear we have nothing against low prices but the consumer should in all transparency have a clear idea in advance of the cost of buying an air ticket inclusive of all costs
as a result there was a huge amount of fraud and irregularity
even among the 53 african union member states nigeria is one of the few where the death penalty is still carried out
mr president ladies and gentlemen i believe that the european unions antidrugs strategy which is on the agenda for debate ought to operate exclusively through a scientific approach through an analysis of the actual situation and of the experience on this issue built up over recent years
this will ensure that bank and fund managers and insurers are able to operate on an euwide basis
for this reason i believe we can make a greater contribution to the security of the world by closing guantnamo by supporting barack obama and by playing an active role if the us administration asks us to do so and if we can work with the government to put in place a process for accepting these people than if we were to preach a false concept of security which mr nassauer could only be implemented if the police and the secret service were to do their job
however that also demonstrates that we have a responsibility to wage that war
first of all the ecb must approve the level of the issue and secondly the issued coins must meet any other legislative measures that harmonise their nominal values and technical specifications
all i would say is that we need to apply properly the good aspects of the maastricht treaty
effective enforcement of judgments in the eu the transparency of debtors assets short presentation
such statements are sectarian irresponsible and deny themselves all legitimacy inasmuch as they fail to call for the same treatment to be meted out to saddam hussein although he alone is responsible for this crisis
the process of democratisation has ground to a complete halt in that country
the trade union confederations cntg and ustg are now the main force in the fight for democracy
the debate is closed
consequently we should also ensure that the network of universities which now exists can obtain adequate support and thereby produce new research
many of the members of this house are actually sceptical about this model of integration which after all is only one of many possible models
the next item is the oneminute speeches on matters of political importance
clearly the road to achieving the primary objective a smokefree europe will be a long one requiring tremendous effort and commitment
although it is contrary to our voting list i would nevertheless like to ask my honourable colleagues to vote in favour of this amendment as well as in favour of the whole report in the second vote
is a company credible if it exports to countries that have not given their permission
resolutions are good but they are not enough
this is the kind of criticism that has been made of the pilot project but unfortunately the commission has not given much of a response
it may also make the eu a world leader in the area of environmental technology where mining is concerned which would be another positive factor and might mean our being able to help other regions of the world
let me say on this point that the commission is fully aware of the need to modernise the motor vehicle insurance directives after all the first of these directives was adopted 30 years ago
i agree it is unacceptable that an important lawmaking body of the eu still meets behind closed doors when acting as a legislator especially at a time when the eu sees itself as a promoter of democratisation and accountability
we can no longer tolerate the people who ruin lives by making money from addicts
indeed volunteering is about citizens initiative and so it is directly related to solidarity the core value of a united europe
laughter

half the population of gaza is under 25years of age and there is 60 unemployment in the area
secondly i cannot share the thinking that the substances are harmful in themselves as it depends on the concentration the situation and how they are used
the context of the current debate is defined by the parallel efforts of the european commission to liberalise the unions energy market with gazprom in the background
during the negotiations we in parliament have been emphasising a transparent and above all unbureaucratic but efficient programme for promoting research
at a time when we are drawing up a constitutional model which ensures that exclusion and discrimination have no place in the enlarged europe we must put an end to this situation failing which our european project and the values that we advocate will lose all credibility
however as you know maintaining and developing services of general interest is solely a matter for the individual member states
at least ask whether the members agree with that decision
lastly i do not believe that merely including the charter of fundamental rights in part ii of the constitution has much significance for the citizens and legal residents of europe without a corresponding definite extension of the possibility of appeal to the court of justice first and foremost in matters of judicial and criminal cooperation
destroy what industry when the one they have is already in ruins
some other members have touched on it and i will say it again quite clearly there must never again be accession treaties without the accession conditions being fulfilled in their entirety
our responsibility is to make use of them
stalin and hitlers regimes must become symbols of evil and be imprinted on our childrens consciousness as murderous systems
first of all as regards mr posselts question as to whether all this means that the applicant countries whether croatia or any other do not have to amend their legislation on samesex marriages abortion or euthanasia the answer is yes
i believe that in the creation of that convention spirit which has been the key to this success you have played a leading role mr president
if we get an agreement in the trialogue tomorrow we can all celebrate
its implementation requires close cooperation between member states institutions and civil society organisations
no matter which search method is used it is still extremely difficult to access legal information both for practitioners of the law and in particular for ordinary citizens looking to protect their rights
if that is not possible i regret to say we shall have to vote against it

on the basis of a study into the operation of the directive which the commission carried out and which can be found in the report from the commission unit we concluded that there is still much room for improvement in all areas and the communication contains several proposals specified by the member states for addressing these shortcomings
this is my offthecuff response
while less debated that the optin for solicited commercial email similar issues are at stake for proposed harmonised optin regarding directories
it is in this element that there lies certainly an opportunity to revive a dialogue that has evaded us
the eus future foreign affairs minister will on the basis of the future european constitution need to fulfil the future mandate on behalf of the eu
i refer here in particular to my own country greece
we think that the proposals put forward for the establishment of a centre for indian studies through collaboration between the european union and india the possibility of holding cultural weeks to coincide with indiaeu summits and designing a strategy to make the european union better known to the indian people should be fundamental
on the one hand we are accommodating the environmental aspect by wanting to avoid empty runs but on the other hand we should not being well aware that the social as well as the fiscal conditions differ greatly from country to country at the present time be encouraging direct dumping in these two sectors either with this regulation
altogether we can all commend this report to the house tomorrow morning and consider it a job well done congratulate the rapporteur and look forward to early implementation of this proposal and a substantial saving in costs and compensation towards industrial injuries caused by cement and probably towards human health caused by nonylphenol ethoxylate
there are currently 208 political prisoners in cuba
ten years on we can see not only that the euro is just as trusted as the currencies previously used in the euro area but also that it has without doubt brought about considerable advantages for people and businesses in the european union
it is a key point here
i turn this time towards my colleagues to say that when we agreed to vote for the package on special events we were entirely in agreement that the concept of european secularism should be fully implemented
all community law and all application of community law is based on action by the national authorities national parliaments national courts and national civil servants
i would also urge mr diamandouros to develop a format for the peaceful settlement of disputes that serves as a model for europe in general
situation in the middle east
this policy has developed in recent years to the level of attempting to completely destroy the palestinian national authority and its institutions and to the systematic destruction of our basic infrastructure which your countries contributed in developing
we are discussing further steps with the un secretariat
perhaps it is also necessary to consider how we use the un
for example the eu has one such delegate for the middle east
i cannot understand why there was no outcry when it became known that in these guidelines the highest political authority is calling for wages to be kept down
a balanced approach to sport activities is one of the answers which means it is not about money in the first place but about the rules and values that govern the world and money to support healthy investment
we are in favour of the full entry into force of the programme produced by the european union involving simultaneous measures of prevention suppression and reintegration
furthermore we would point out the risks of genetic confidentiality not being respected and of genetic profiling being misused for example to refuse people jobs or insurance
sweden and the june list question what is known as the country of origin principle according to which a television company has to follow the regulations in place in the country from which it broadcasts irrespective of where its programmes are viewed because this leads to problems when for example tv 3 and kanal 5 broadcast from the united kingdom where they are covered by british rather than swedish legislation
this measure was announced even though the european commission has not yet completed its evaluation of an earlier package of italian measures
i would like to conclude with particular reference to the real importance of taking into account the need to create special framework conditions based on a multiannual approach for this in controls and measures or rural development projects
they are not going to be deprived of these products and you cannot stop them personally i think they are absolutely right in this respect
i think that this is the best proof of our success
that is i think what the minister was saying and he has our total support
this is a very important document which is part of an energy efficiency package
after all the organisation was secret and the objective of such secrecy is to prevent the people from knowing of its existence
my final hope is that the june council will take a clear decision
instead of acting accordingly and pressing for an immediate halt to immigration from islamic countries as well as getting to grips with the repatriation of illegal immigrants the eu is adopting a softlysoftly approach to avoid vexing the muslims who are here already
but sometimes the breadth of the agenda has been lost amidst shrill debates about clamping down on illegal immigration as though that were the major purpose of migration policy
lithuania and cyprus which were meant to receive four and two posts respectively are facing the same problem taking the total to three countries
that would be an easy way of shirking our political responsibility
in response the european commission activated the community civil protection mechanism the mechanism facilitates and coordinates member states inkind assistance during major emergencies
there will still not be a code of ethics a collective agreement and a system of equalisation to ensure fairness amongst all assistants as my colleague from the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party said where there is equal pay for work of equal value

and we should not be trying to impose the template of the eus institutional structure on another continent without reflection on the appropriateness of such a structure for europe let alone africa
that is true but the employment situation in europe is anything but encouraging
we must strengthen it as mr silva peneda urges by strengthening fundamental labour legislation through the establishment of minimum standards in employment rights by fighting discrimination by strengthening social cohesion by modernising social insurance systems by fighting poverty by promoting the transition to selfemployment and by strengthening the structural funds
that commissioner is why we are asking you what action you propose taking if by the end of the year not all the member states have transposed this directive
let that be quite clear
a measure of this type can have grave consequences for the development of certain of our tourist resorts
if nearly every other restriction on competition is removed from the new block exemption regulation which as we have said is a good thing which we expressly support then i think that we can keep the location clause in place for dealers for the time being in order to ensure among other things that dealers in areas with less purchasing power and i come from just such an outlying region can survive and that the consumer supply line is not cut
it serves as a social model an economic model a political model and also as a model of integration
mr president commissioner i am myself from the vorarlberg one of the places affected but am every bit as deeply affected by what is going on in portugal and in the southern states of the usa
what is being discussed here is a specific concept of europe or to be more precise the way that our fellow citizens perceive europe
mrpresident after more than a year of discussion regarding this directive the position of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party is clear and has remained almost unchanged
however may i draw his attention to the daphnefunded analyses recently conducted surveys focusing particularly on longterm institutional care averaging 13months of children under three years of age which is the time when they are most likely to be damaged neurologically
finally with regard to decentralised agencies we have taken account of the life cycle of these agencies
the un and the european union emerged from the ashes of the devastation of the second world war
this deterioration is certainly being signalled by the huge wave of arrests and the violence being shown to the regimes opponents
this was one of the greatest successes achieved in the run up to the wto ministerial conference held in hong kong in december 2005
i voted in favour
you will be very welcome but it is complex and it will take some time to resolve what is a difficult situation
if the eu renders it necessary to take the north from the turkish population war will follow
for example what do we mean by flexibility
it is in this spirit therefore that the french presidency organised last july with valérie pécresse the first informal meeting of european space ministers at kourou which as you know is the european spaceport
it seems that many of their people believe it is all a matter for government
es madam president i wished to stress how strange it is that there are no concrete legislative proposals for a common policy such as the common fisheries policy
we must try to unite the parties and try to persuade them to work together
i recognise that this issue warrants a farreaching open debate but as everyone knows i am in favour of a substantial increase in the quantity of budgetary aid
this does not seem to me to be an impressive result for the austrian presidency
the centre right and centre left supporters of the european oneway street are commending and are eager for outright intervention by the eu in the internal affairs of the eu of the member states are supporting the sovereignty of big business in the field of information and are jostling with unsavoury confrontations and masked intentions to see who will win the favour of the plutocracy to best serve its interests
the evidence proves it perhaps more intensely in greece
it is also right to develop a perspective for continuing to monitor the reform processes if necessary even in the years after accession
it is rather depressing to hold a conciliation procedure at the end of july while everyone else was on holiday only to find that the council then fails to honour the agreements we made
europe was born in the coffee houses of europe
there is nothing wrong with the amendment in itself
this is how i have worked and i believe the other rapporteurs have done the same and therefore although it has been a particularly complicated and difficult year as all we members of the committee know we have been lucky enough to have the leadership of our president who has shown great responsibility at all times and i believe that the final result will be satisfactory
then there is a monstrosity which commissioner patten mentioned too the wall the wall of separation of apartheid of annexing of territory
while the commission is indeed prepared to promptly implement under the new neighbourhood policy the closer cooperation with the new president that we seek it is not in the least irrelevant to us how this election is won
we need economic and technical dialogue between europe and latin america similar to our dialogue with the united states
this means that we enjoy excellent cooperation and also as mrsprets has already said our voice has been heard
and so russias responsibility must not be ignored
that is where we have the problem which derives from the fact that the proposal and the ideas presented by the commission lose a very great deal of credibility as far as the area between verona and munich is concerned by seeking to amend a protocol to the act of accession unilaterally
the member states do not all follow the same view
we will put forward options for a european union climate change policy and perspectives for international cooperation postkyoto
i will try to deal as directly as possible with the seven questions raised by mr brok
equally worthy of consideration are the ban on blending olive oil with other oils or fats and the incentive to the producer organisation to increase market supply capacity because this is the paradox to overcome a rising demand for consumption of this precious commodity and a fall in prices
i am astonished commissioner dimas by the lack of any more proactive approach in your speech
however at least on the commission side we cannot say that there is any reluctance to cooperate with us concerning standards and the quality of the products
the first is the same question put by mr swoboda who asked for more time for the debate on the european council and the issue of the referendum
i am aware that commissioner mandelson has pushed financial services quite hard and i am pleased to hear from the commissioner that he is intending to do so
firstly there was the matter of general principle that in the interests of promoting better simpler and clearer legislation the introduction of an unevenly weighted dual legal basis represents a dangerous direction and precedent in european policymaking
far greater resources are needed in the area of health especially in africa
mr president in my one minute of speaking time i would like to focus on three issues based on my amendments adopted by the committee on the environment public health and food safety yesterday
thirdly the implications of such systems for individuals are not clear
subject revision of regulation ec no 12005
it means safer food across europe it means that if you buy a tomato in ireland that has come from spain you can guarantee the quality and safety of that product
despite long debates and a great deal of effort at persuasion we have not managed to regain our grip on reality
mr swoboda mr jarzembowski it is my understanding that the longer you talk the more you seem to be seeing eye to eye
we can design the tools at our disposal for maximum efficiency
this is why we absolutely insist and this is for us in the committee on womens rights and equal opportunities and i believe also for all the women in parliament a real must that cooperation with countries be suspended if they fail to take measures to prevent violence against women stoning public chastisement genital mutilation cremation or rape
the vote will take place tomorrow thursday at 12 noon
it is a real chance probably the last chance we are going to have to do something to help those poor countries
article 23 of the basic law however is a potential time bomb under all of this
mr president commissioner i fully support what you said today and i know how committed you are to plan d however what you said today about the constitution is not in the papers
all democratic forces should now therefore unite in demanding referendums on the next treaty in all the countries and why not on the same day
having seen what has happened in a number of large private banks i would say that those who gave lectures were very poorly placed to give them and that they should now prepare themselves to receive them
the attitude of eurostat and also of the polish central statistical office convince me of this
in future therefore electronic data and documents will be subjected to scrutiny yielding data on production and on the type of produce
it is still very early days for the transatlantic economic council and expectations are naturally very high
mr president i very much welcome this opportunity to discuss relations between the european union and the united nations and i want to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the quality of his report
it is particularly significant that there is widespread lack of knowledge in the member states about the european employment strategy and that their national plans do not contain quantitative objectives specifically employment rates for women as defined at the lisbon summit and nor are these plans being presented in the national parliaments or debates held on their content
in accordance with article 32 of the regulation these aspects are to be included in a report that is to be presented within four years and may be accompanied by a new proposal
having to reinsure and reregister can be such hindrances
mr president this house is becoming habitual in passing resolutions resolutions which are totally ineffective to a very large extent
it is very important not to forget these aspects concerning the method if we want the report to be adopted with as broad a political foundation as possible
it accepts that as a result of the outcome of the second world war with the united states playing a dominant role in western europe such agreements were made and that these have persisted through time
commissioner as you know we are also concerned about the tragic situation which according to the undersecretary general responsible for humanitarian affairs at the un is threatening one million people in afghanistan with famine
we have just received the enormous document approximately 200 pages of the draft regulation laying down health rules concerning products intended for animal feed
mrs frassoni commissioner wallstrm has already promised that in future we will create a citizens summary
secondly continuing my straightforward train of thought which code of conduct are we referring to
let me very briefly give some of the elements of the statistical board which i will do in writing
there are known cases of duty being applied to vehicles purchased by polish citizens in eu countries despite rulings by the court of justice and of delays in refunding wrongly calculated charges that have been paid
yes we need shortterm emergency measures for the present marine fuel crisis together with medium and longterm restructuring informed by environmental and economic rationale instead of making criminals of our most productive and efficient fishermen who lie awake wondering as one irish fishermens spokesman said will it be the boat or the house that will go first
the council of ministers will be refocused towards the tasks of the legislative and general affairs councils and the various formations within it will be regrouped
the next item is the report by zdzisaw kazimierz chmielewski on behalf of the committee on fisheries on the proposal for a council regulation establishing a multiannual plan for the cod stocks in the baltic sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks c602812006
mr president ladies and gentlemen difficult negotiations have concluded with a creditable result
bees are being decimated by disease and pests with which beekeepers cannot cope alone
the package is also an example of solidarity within the european union
when you actually look at the commissions approach to the whole issue of fisheries over the last few years you will see that the commission in fact used to be the most progressive of the eu institutions pushing very hard for conservation and reasonable management of fish stocks with of course the obvious exception of thirdcountry agreements
there are many other alcoholrelated issues that are being followed up right now but probably not this one for the moment because it is of course not an eu competence
this is no longer a problem just for africa or asia
heeding calls for savings and imposing arbitrary cuts in order to make savings at any price would be akin to expecting a rocket carrier that originally consisted of three stages to carry an object into space even if you remove one of its stages the end result will be that we are left with nothing
the fulfilment of the roadmap must be our objective and the international community must make every possible effort to achieve that
i find this very useful because it goes without saying that we need to continue to make adjustments in the future
the code of conduct is not the strongest instrument we have at our disposal
that international community is however beginning to realise the dangers of suspending aid to the palestinian people
these account for approximately 355 of europes total budget
for the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party it is vital that there be no renationalisation of the eu s competition policy
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i should like to start by offering my warmest congratulations to my honourable friend mrs kratsa on her firstrate report which really does give us an excellent overview of past achievements and future developments
this time we must put everything on the table without any preconditions and the discussion must start from a zero base
it should for example be possible to be more flexible when measurements are taken if bathing water in a certain location has been clean for years it should be possible to reduce its measuring frequency
i believe that it should also be communicated accordingly
a proposal capable of being implemented will not only help make it possible for the negotiations to continue in a constructive climate but also help show that sound protection of the environment and of human health can be combined with trade
mr president i wish first of all to congratulate terence wynn and elmar brok on their initiative of tabling this motion for a resolution which is unquestionably of the utmost importance and extremely timely
can the priorities be changed within the existing framework or do we need to revise the framework itself
at the same time there are responsibilities incumbent upon the commission in the areas of the free circulation of goods protection of public health and respect of international rules
it is not just the winner of the prize but also the nominees who deserve our great respect and deep recognition
no
we therefore propose that we do not accept this proposal
we believe that it is up to the institutions to promote certain policies including maritime safety and it is up to this house to ensure political control which up to today and even today some people have tried to deny it
it was that agreement into which we entered with the council
are there no more comments
simply consider the enormous widening of responsibilities of this house finally it is a fullyfledged european parliament
i am well aware that this proposal is complex and sensitive
the second key point i would like to mention is that the commission is delegating more and more of its functions to agencies and to executive agencies
in practice mainstreaming has meant increasing interaction between human rights experts and national thinktanks and presenting aspects of human rights in different eu areas of activity such as crisis management and the export of arms
the joint declaration on building policy emphasises the importance of a medium to longterm approach to building
after a number of years i believe we are now on the right track towards finding a solution with which both the council and parliament can be satisfied
mr president commissioner i want to give my honourable friend mrs pack an explanation as regards the letter
i declare myself in favour of a social europe
it proved to be complicated at the beginning because of its implications but they convinced us that it was worthwhile
a month before the elections in ukraine we do not know who will be president
the terrorist argument of double standards in european societies is something they pray for so that they can enlist new terrorists so that they can undermine our policy
indeed in my previous life as a foreign minister i visited mauritania and was struck by the fact that although the majority of its population are muslims mauritania is one of the only muslim countries that maintains relations with israel and therefore tries to be evenhanded
although it was supposed to provide a fast and effective response this mechanism is deemed to be complex even inefficient
the eu market is flooded with defective goods that we are purchasing from china
rear registration plate of two or threewheel motor vehicles vote
i believe that the current problems do not as i have said many times relate to the stability pact but that they are problems relating to the reforms necessary to increase our growth potential in europe
subject payment of cap support for areas hit by fires
i hope that in this area the convention will live up to the historical challenges that lie ahead and the expectations of the citizens
as far as the timing is concerned for reasons of fairness and trustworthiness the industry has to be given the time we have granted it that is until 2008
the forthcoming accession of romania and bulgaria more or less puts the finishing touches to this development
where does this leave the community
i think it is important that the commission should uphold this because i believe the greatest threat to citizens privacy is the omnipotence of the state in accessing personal data
meetings took place in stockholm on 14 march and in brussels on 26 april
in the liability regulation in favour of passengers on passenger ships there is unfortunately only a regulation for the maritime area
parliament has also succeeded in achieving the position that distribution between air traffic routes should depend on direct communication between the airports concerned
the families will tell you of their burning sense of injustice at this state of affairs and their anger that the killer of their loved one will continue to lead their own life see their own children grow spend time with friends and all of those things that they have robbed from their victim
that collaborative and consensusdriven methodology can also be applied to other areas under the asylum and migration
in the final agreement there will of course be some risk that not all compulsory expenditure is covered in what was decided in the package
it as i pointed out in my answer to question no h008603 by the honourable member a final report on the implementation of programmes ad hoc centres pilot projects and joint operations was presented at the justice and home affairs council of 5 and 6 june 2003 with a view to it being sent to the thessaloniki european council
i am delighted that the committee on petitions participates in the network as a full member and was represented at the meeting of national ombudsmen that took place in the hague in september 2005
now it is obvious that within the framework of a constitution there is some sort of internal revision procedure that bypasses the general circuit of treaties and of the twentyfive or twentyseven ratifications
similarly i do not believe that we have to make a choice between nice or lisbon
i know i can count on you commissioner with your political leadership to deal with that but i think we all need to be engaged in that process not to make those detailed decisions but to say to the people involved get together and step up those efforts because we all want you to succeed
all the member states need to invest in these areas and they need to do so right away otherwise we will not reach the targets of our own climate package
the oral question to the commission b604832008 by mr pribetich on behalf of the committee on industry research and energy on the european space policy how to bring space down to earth
i am thinking above all of the iraqi people themselves who rightly or wrongly as many have said here consider the occupation of their country to be unacceptable regardless of the justification
i would like to ask the commission what it has done to enable it to operate under new conditions in 2009 under a new treaty and will there be a greater number of commissioners or not
the commission fully shares these feelings and like parliament is currently promoting the inclusion of a charter on fundamental human rights in the eu treaty so that it will become legally binding and directly enforceable
her report is cleverly formulated but is in my opinion based on an erroneous point of view
however i can commit to it only with the provisos that deadlines are respected and sufficient resources are made available by all partners in the process
maybe however there is a deeper legal meaning to it and maybe it will prove to be helpful
compulsory tobacco detectors in every home
however although i realise that integration is important i believe it must occur with the consent of our citizens
for this reason i have proposed that the secretariat of the contact network be established within the existing secretariat of the european crimeprevention network
what is most important therefore is not new rules but guarantees that the existing rules are complied with
what has become clear here today and i am sure that this reflects opinion in all of your groups is that the common mind and will of the overwhelming majority in your house is that this europe of ours be moved forward and moreover with a dose of optimism thrown in of the kind referred to by the chairman of the socialist group mr schulz whom i too on the assumption that i in my capacity as presidentinoffice of the council am allowed to do so want to praise today for that the situation is historic and a very serious one is a point on which i agree entirely with all those who have made it today
laughter applause
the debate is closed
we are now approaching the conclusion of this project

we continue to feed ruminants and eat them in our countries
give us this legal basis and we will do the rest
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on regional development pl madam president i would like to thank mr becsey for his report
we are not happy about a measure of the italian government having to be appraised in this house
even the few positive points of the report seem to be framed within a context that aims to deceive public opinion and the citizens through propaganda campaigns rather than effectively ensure democratic participation and bring about a change in policy to respond to the reasonable aspirations of individuals and workers
europols budget should be financed from the community budget and the information given to the european parliament should likewise be looked at from a different viewpoint
one of the functions of policy is to set clear boundaries for business multinational conglomerates must accept much more responsibility for society and the environment and the triple bottom line approach is one example of how they can do so

what we have before us is what was negotiated with the italian presidency and unanimously adopted in the council as part of a political agreement and in essence the same as what was adopted by this houses committee on economic and monetary affairs and by its committee on legal affairs and the internal market
why does the commission not set itself the task of mounting an inquiry into this and to publish the findings via the bbc and whatever other stations are listened to in africa
de mr president globalisation which is what this is all about is happening whether we want it to or not and it goes hand in hand with the openingup of markets with international competition with economic growth with the creation of new jobs but unfortunately also with the loss of jobs in those sectors that are less competitive
the european union has to be the europe of freedom and freedom only exists in a healthy economic environment where there is real and effective security
this is the reason why we have not voted for this report
bearing in mind that the 2007 budget is the first budget within the new financial framework it is to be hoped that it will augur well for subsequent years
gradually the international maritime organisation imo has established clearer regulations based among other things on customary law
fortunately they clarify some provisions of the text
my third point relates to the contribution of women to this debate
if we are to pursue a responsible policy we must concern ourselves with the health of europeans particularly the youngest among them
in october the commission is going to publish a report on this issue which i hope will also be debated and monitored in parliament
the eu is all about an open market and we have to care for eu citizens
nl we voted against the whole sturdy report and most amendments to it including those of the eldr and the green group because they are in favour of an increase in subsidies and promote intensive animalunfriendly husbandry
we need a craftsman a handyman rather than a statesman
mr president commissioner unfortunately you have not had the opportunity yet and i am pleased to give you this opportunity now to reply to my earlier questions about the 500 new positions the lack of manpower to monitor compliance with environmental legislation and also to the question of whether candidate countries should get the bureaucratic redtape underway as early as 2003 to apply for structural funds so as to guarantee the highest possible level of implementation in 2004
so much is this selfevident that we ought not to need to legislate
this is the latest episode in a chain of serious violations of human rights which have entailed the repression of political opponents homosexuals journalists intellectuals and anyone who is fighting for the social and civil development of iran

barcelona was a very good idea but there was one problem at the barcelona summit
in its resolution parliament called on the commission to waste no time in presenting a proposal for a framework directive regulating collective crossborder management of copyright and related intellectual property rights for legitimate online music services
but it is a very serious issue and one that i have huge concerns about
therefore the council has pressed the turkish authorities to take suitable steps to avoid further deaths
i have repeatedly attended sessions during which you have chaired question time and i have no complaints
how to deal with drug abuse and how to fight organised crime are topics for political debate
thirdly farreaching decisions in the fisheries sector also means that a number of regions will actually be affected
whilst the commission based on what emerged from the eurobarometer survey has managed to indicate the topics that are of concern for the europeans how does it assess the state of affairs in all those national discussions about european cooperation the direction in which we are going and the constitution
for example from the point of view of recreational activity if we are talking about a seaside area where hundreds of people go boating for example that is quite a different matter from a 50 kilometrelong river in lapland where canoes are used

ro i would first of all like to congratulate mrs stavreva for the quality of the report which she presented to us today
how often have we demanded as we are doing again that the commission show greater respect for the particular responsibility of parliament as advocate of the european public for the protection of fundamental rights

this is an important aspect

in conclusion i would note that drug problems in the eu are in large measure a consequence of the prevailing poverty in many countries in the world

in fact we need to totally renegotiate the 1951 geneva convention and think again
this wideranging report is complemented by that of ms lambert on how to include people who are frequently excluded from the labour market
those are the things we were looking at and it has been rejected by members of the ppede group
that is our basic view
this provision appears to run counter to member states international obligations on childrens rights
we welcome this appointment as a step in the right direction
for this reason to be able to meet these commitments in terms of reducing ghg emissions and increasing the share of renewable energy sources major structural reforms are required in every area of the economy
i remain confident however that with a constructive debate it will be possible to achieve a solution which ensures maximum safety in these plants
last week the american congress adopted a belarus democracy act which takes measures to which europe should also give consideration
our fishing fleets keep within the legally imposed tacs and quotas on fleet sizes
the european institutions like to pride themselves on their international leadership in terms of policy on climate change the greatest threat we face and yet this regulation is a tragedy of missed opportunity and sets back the potential of our climate policy by decades
with public procurement to encourage the replacement of old vehicle fleets with new vehicles is to put the economy at the service of the environment to reduce co2 emissions in order to create demand is to put the environment at the service of the economy this is a perfect equilibrium constructing this virtuous circle on the budgetary level on the ecological level and on the level of transparency
other examples include the councils problematic dealings with uzbekistan and iran
it is an extremely hot potato after release 60 guantnamo prisoners returned to terrorist activity and therefore each case should be examined individually
the european social model is a model of an active society where activity in the labour market is the key element
finally i cannot understand why the commissioner is not putting pressure on member states to ensure that they comply with natura 2000 in the alpine regions or why we do not have officially adopted lists of sites of community interest
i expect the european parliament to play an important role here
the hague programme also reflects the fact that the external dimension of asylum is being recognised as increasingly important in the eu
we need in the global context to insist on appropriate regulation but to try to discover as parliamentarians what it is
the international community must stand firm behind this comprehensive peace agreement

globally the increase for institutions amounts to eur 31 million compared to the eur 48 million requested
as i have already said the adoption of this third maritime safety package is a significant victory for the european legislative process
the data protection directive lays down some very strict rules and i think that it has emerged from the debate which has been very wideranging and very complicated that the situation is developing very rapidly
we do not want to impose any rules but we do expect the sectors to use their common sense for doing nothing leads to inertia and an enormous drop in dynamism and competitiveness

in terms of creating a fair trading system the eu has made a significant contribution with its everythingbutarms initiative
many people have been arrested
i think that the environment stands to benefit from this as does our economy because we will then have minimum harmonisation
to come back to the report i should like to emphasise that it is already possible as the law now stands to provide targeted support for hill and mountain farming through compensatory payments which form and shall continue to form our basic support for mountain regions and through environmental measures through aid for forestry through processing aid and marketing aid or through diversification aid for example in the tourism sector
why not consider a specific structural fund for mountain regions
i will only give you one example that of records
it has the ability to do so but its problem is that its growth potential is so terribly low incomparably low
secondly the commission takes note of the emphasis that parliaments report puts on an overall quantitative reduction of the use of pesticides whilst the communication puts more emphasis on reducing the risks

even a constitutional debate offers an opportunity to people with that parochial mentality people who are incapable of grasping what is at stake

mrpresident i wrote to you at the end of last week to inform you of the recent events with regard to human rights violations in tunisia but my letter is already out of date one undoubtedly has to be prepared for anything and everything to happen in that country
this is clearly stated in the commissions communication and it is also how brazil perceives it
there is no room for doubt the calling to account is justified there must be a proposal for a resolution there must be a europeanlevel strategy and every member state must prepare an action plan for integrating the roma
we want the environment to be respected and protected since in many cases it provides the main source of economic and social stability for its people
many developing countries themselves give it far too low a priority
i shall conclude by saying that it is very difficult to make something good out of essentially a poor suggestion or to use an agricultural term you cannot make a silk purse out of a sows ear
i would particularly like to thank the council and the commission the council both under the german presidency and under the portuguese presidency
all the past problems have been resolved which we are very pleased about
the reforms together with external financial assistance have allowed him to increase expenditure in gaza and west bank since the beginning of the year by meeting arrears and salary payments
mr president this has i think been a very good solution and i am grateful for your courtesy towards myself and my colleague
this is an urgent matter and one to which we cannot close our eyes
i want to say how much i am in agreement with mrrosati it would indeed be much to be desired when considering these important issues for the council which alone is competent to act on many of these issues in the context of the lisbon strategy to apply itself with greater earnestness to this matter and if the debates in this house were not to be in the hands only of its own members and the members of the commission and while it is indeed the case that the commission does have an important function to perform in ensuring that the measures already adopted at council level are actually implemented by the member states we must nevertheless be honest for as we shall probably see later on when considering the ry report what matters at the end of the day is that the member states should keep to what they themselves once decided
that would entail the centralisation of labour market policy in the long run and a shift towards unilateral economic policy
fruit juice and fruit juice from concentrate are in the final analysis one and the same product
on behalf of the pse group madam president i would also like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work on this report on the statistics programme 20082012
commissioner i have listened very carefully to your reply for 6 minutes but i would like to ask from a political point of view whether it can seriously be argued that the removal of these preferences through the modulation mechanism is going to benefit a country such as colombia which has 26 million people living in poverty and in which 30 000 people die as a result of violence each year
it reminded me that the european union is capable of regaining the support of its citizens by leading a truly efficient campaign against global climate change
the commission expects that the parliamentary and subsequent presidential elections will be carried out democratically in an atmosphere of responsible debate and political stability
growth in europe must be raised in qualitative terms back to rates of at least 3
let us refrain from lapsing into american conditions
similarly article 9 states that during sessions of the european parliament its members shall enjoy in the territory of their own state the immunities accorded to members of their parliament and in the territory of any other member state immunity from any measure of detention and from legal proceedings
i therefore take the view that we must reject a second batch of amendments on which we will be voting tomorrow in which the category of sufficient has been deleted
we have only managed to bring in this maritime package in as much as we have been united and have shown solidarity to such an extent that certain fellow members have so to speak inherited some stowaways such as my text and that of mr fernandes which the council did not want
focards heirs
making cuts hurts but it also opens up new opportunities
i regard it as an unworthy trick to confront ten countries that have made the journey by way of a great process of transformation from dictatorship to being invited to join the european union with a situation that makes them insecure and at the same time to go about curtailing parliaments rights even though it was the advent of democracy that was crucial in overcoming dictatorship
in the absence of any european legislation each member state is free to make its own rules
i hope commissioner that this reform will be completed before the current commission gives way to the next and i am asking you this in the very interest of the prodi commission
mrs frassoni whom i had met in the course of our debates in the convention talks about intergovernmental methods
they are all equally important and each has its contribution to make
i would therefore like to stress again the importance of reaching firstreading agreement on an issue which is so important to european union citizens
if there are documents and impact assessments they should be clearly attached to that
i should like to start by expressing my very deep gratitude to the rapporteurs mr harbour and mr medina ortega for their very thorough thoughtful and constructive work on this important issue of the reform of the staff regulations
this list will be approved by the procedure of control regulation
nunca mis was the cry we heard from november onwards in my region galicia in other regions they were listening much further away but also in other european regions that were affected by the prestige disaster not the erika disaster the prestige disaster
this is a matter of joint concern
the purpose of approving a new legal instrument a directive is to reduce the amount of packaging and other polluting waste products by setting out a series of bolder objectives than those provided in the previous directive which is still in force today
the solutions we recommend are much less onerous than those mobilised for the financial crisis and even if we were finally to introduce the pollination bonus and financial assistance to beekeepers in difficulty to ensure the survival of bees in europe it would be peanuts in comparison with other budget lines
would it not be simpler to give them a little less money rather than making them pay tax
the situation must be considered a mess on the part of the council
mr president the ebner report is going to offer the commission a very good model to follow when producing its communication for the international year of mountains 2002
i could reply in the same tone i am not going to do so
absolutely no one and least of all mrs wallis
we were elected by the people we are not representatives of our governments
there will be greater use of qualified majority voting in the council and the creation of a number of new legal foundations in areas such as tourism sport energy civil defence and administrative cooperation
firstly we were able to successfully complete the european unionchile negotiations in due time to allow mr prodi mr aznar and mr lagos to announce the official conclusion of the negotiations and the establishment of our much awaited association agreement

mr president ladies and gentlemen the republic of taiwan was shaken to its foundations on 8 august typhoon morakot swept across the island with unbridled force leaving more than 750 people dead
fifthly to the reduction of bureaucratic requirements because the national electronic registers will be networked and access to these should be made easier and simplified templates for community licences and driver attestation are also planned
secondly coming from parliaments rapporteur on corporate social responsibility the commissioner will not be surprised to be told that his commitment to simply promoting the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprise is wholly inadequate in parliaments view as the european unions contribution to developing global corporate accountability
in any event the central issue must be the attraction factor particularly at academic level
that is the major opportunity which this directive offers
i must emphasise that the management structure and legal field in which icann develops must be based on transparency neutrality and independence
i believe that you will be called on to take further steps as regards this issue
so this is absolutely essential if we are not to put in jeopardy the lives of british and other haemophiliacs
each member state should allow its parliament to vote on the eus financial perspective before the council of ministers takes its decision so that the decision is not taken secretly but openly and clearly with people aware of the financial commitments they will assume
i note in passing that we and our russian partners need urgently to come to a shared understanding of this point
it is obvious that bulgaria and romania do not fulfil those requirements we chose to set down from the beginning
this is why article 29 of the treaty of amsterdam refers specifically to common action in three areas closer cooperation between police forces customs agencies and other competent authorities including europol closer cooperation between member states judicial authorities and approximation where necessary of criminal law provisions
perhaps the health check is the perfect opportunity to do this
this package on climate action and renewable energy meets the challenges of the future
instead the council has decided to proceed with such an extensive reallocation of resources that there will be such limited scope for debate in 20082009 that serious discussion will scarcely be on the cards
while for example the report considers that there are high employment rates and that unemployment has fallen at european union level the commission itself highlighted the increase in unemployment the high rate of structural and longterm unemployment the low productivity of labour the high level of taxation on low incomes etc in greece at the beginning of march
additional rules on the common organisation of the milk and milk products markets vote
while the final countdown has begun and less and less time remains there nonetheless remains a huge amount to be done even where the budget prior to 2003 is concerned
that was what you said two weeks ago but now it has increased to 4
that is why this legislation has been put in place
this was warmly supported by a majority in the socialist group in the european parliament
the stability and growth pact and the monetary policy of the european central bank provide a reliable satisfactory framework and all we need to do is to stick to it
the importance of these provisions was also emphasised by the heads of state and government at the lisbon summit in march 2000
so minister please get it sorted
madam president it is a great tribute to the work of günther verheugen jonathan evans and others that we are meeting here today to follow up this really important initiative
could you commissioner dimas say something more and more specific about what instruments the eu possesses to deal with this
i think this represents a deliberate intrusion into the field in order to undertake further work on matrimonial law and its harmonisation
you are now urging the commission to review all contracts concluded by the statistical office since 1999 by july this year as well that is 2 660 contracts
consequently political leaders need to anticipate this sort of disaster by planning measures which help to prevent where possible and using all available resources to deal with such crises in the most efficient way possible
the committee on culture and education has tabled an amendment relating to cases where a media service provider has established itself in the member state having jurisdiction in order to avoid the stricter rules in the fields coordinated by the directive

those countries that are currently the subjects of a possible future accession have a long way to go
they say that they have already done what needs to be done
mr bouwman mentioned that middleaged workers had asked him at a fair what he could do about work for them
on the other point unsolicited commercial emails i have preferred and the committee on citizens freedoms and rights has followed me not to accept the commission proposal of imposing a harmonised europewide optin system but to leave each member state the choice of opting in or opting out
i am determined as i said earlier to conduct this issue by the agreement and entirely according to the law
enabling such countries to become more involved in european capital of culture events is a unique opportunity to harness the unprecedented energy generated by societies in the socalled young democracies
however most of the media attention was focused on events taking place outside the summit on the city streets
as the amendment says we would like to adopt guidelines for the decision to establish select and appoint eu special representatives and for the regular assessment of their work
i regret that it is only in french and english at this juncture
thank you commissioner fischler
we are indeed working with fishermen ngos and private partners in europe and in these countries precisely to try and reduce as much as possible all negative interaction and unfair competition between our fishermen and the most vulnerable fishermen in these countries
when drawing up an antinicotine policy therefore we must examine the problem from a number of angles to ensure that the legal reality we establish provides effective help in solving the problems linked to the use of nicotine products
i can however assure you here and now that it makes no sense whatsoever
in my opinion this message has to be a positive one
i would like to point out that we in the committee on womens rights and equal opportunities have already on several occasions proposed what was agreed here this morning to make 2004 the european year of education through sport
there needs to be an arena in which european politicians both at european and national levels can meet on an organised basis
with regard to the transfer to the second pillar let me point out again that we have reintroduced our inpart programme

presidentinoffice of the council fr mr president firstly thank you for this discussion
these plasma products particularly in the uk and ireland are largely imported from the us from paid donors
it is difficult to see how a continued centralisation of power in the kremlin would help us understand this policy
commissioner parliaments vote on services has shown the way
he will of course be present during the extraordinary partsession in brussels but will be accompanying the prime minister of his country and will not therefore be speaking as presidentinoffice of the council
today the economic situation is such especially in the pension systems in both the public and private sectors that it would find it very hard to tolerate this sort of solution
how cheap then is european citizenship which is forced on people is unwanted and cannot be refused or renounced
secondly we are not prepared to make the real switch from agricultural subsidy to rural and environmental policy for the sake of internal social cohesion and our priority which is knowledge
i am certain that it does not happen
well then these ties have convinced me still further to do all i can and to support the moreover extremely positive report on the state of romania s accession negotiations
there is only eitheror
this is in fact something we have always pointed out for every amendment to this directive
it was subsequently approved again in 2008 and then a few days ago it was prohibited
i believe that innovative projects on a smaller scale can have just as much practical use indeed if not more so than those costing many millions of euros
in addition we should review the geneva convention with a view to finding a suitable response to the problem of stateless terrorist armies
in summary the proposal now before us is in my opinion unacceptable for in the first place it infringes the right of ownership secondly does not respect agreements entered into and thirdly identifies votedifferentiated shares as an obstacle to takeovers
mr president ladies and gentlemen i want to thank mr ebner very much for the work he has done and also for accepting my amendments to the text

the provisions of the new financial regulation require the creation of a clear complete detailed legal basis for european standardisation

i believe that one of these comments which he made during a meeting of the foreign affairs ministers of the eu member states held in luxembourg on 18october2005 had a particularly ominous ring to it
from the outset the european community has been at the forefront of the debate on trips and access to medicines
it is good that there have been improvements to the food safety authority in terms of both time and resources

now there has been much speculation in the european parliament as to who might be the model for irina vega with our rapporteur being the most widely mentioned
mr snchezneyra yes there does need to be a european dimension to sport and i think that it could only be beneficial if the statistics for the olympic games were counted nation by nation but if there were a specific column for european medals
that is not a point of order
we are now in the process of trying to convert this confidence and optimism into real evidence of an upturn in the economic situation with more consumption more jobs and more economic growth
the time has now come for the governments of europe to wake up
mr president as a european citizen even more than as a member of parliament i would like to quietly express my indignation at the way the committee s work was carried out
in addition the report provides that in future once sufficient experience has been gained in this field the commission should be called on to submit a legislative proposal to strengthen cooperation among member states and improve the recognition and enforcement of decisions on the protection of adults and incapacity mandates
firstly we want a successful multilateral round
in the european water forum one of our objectives is transparency in providing information to the public and we are now seriously addressing our commitment to transparency of information to the public
i really do feel and i have said as much in the commission that we need to take proper account of this difference when we implement the policy
why has it been communicated to the european union so late and so badly
i believe that in this matter the council has just made its will very clear
then my group will emphasise what it considers to be positive advances new parliamentary prerogatives a willingness to encourage ordinary people to get involved and certain elements of transparency
in its conclusions the council has time after time confirmed it commitment to reaching an agreement at the next and sixth conference of the parties to safeguarding the kyoto protocol s environmental integrity and to creating conditions for its ratification and entry into force by 2002 at the latest

one of the north korean governments core demands would appear to be that it should be allowed to negotiate directly with the usa

if one takes into account the normal period for adoption that date will then be in 2011
this is why i would like to offer my particularly enthusiastic support to mr piecyks report in order to be able to discuss the issue of bus and coach transport and to vote in june
this should become one of the commissions priorities in this whole process of change
mr president this parliament has a very good record as a strong supporter of the peace process in northern ireland and indeed we were strong backers of the peace fund for northern ireland
i have said it before in this parliament this crisis is causing real hardship and this is nowhere more visible than the impact on the jobs market
in that knowledge we must apply the social market economy in each piece of policy we lay down
the people of those countries have ever more doubts about their right to occupy a place in our european democracy

indeed i firmly believe that only seven months before the anticipated accession date of 1january 2007 it is our duty finally and clearly to confirm this date or say that it no longer applies
i therefore voted in favour
we believe that such a development would be extremely unfortunate
it is true that we do not have to return to the past but there are certain principles that we believe still to be valid and the first is the defence of multilateralism above all else in todays world and also our commitment
this is a very fastgrowing development in the uk and ireland where in particular new participants in schemes are not given a defined benefit system
the commission cannot support the rapporteurs proposal to allow despite everything the installation of sidefacing seats in coaches

so my question is as follows who determines the difference in meaning between a joint flight and a group flight

we must ensure that we get global certainties and agreements for the future and not refight old battles
on the contrary the reduction of the irregular employment of foreigners has resulted in additional income for national budgets
maybe what we need is just an evaluation of the whole gamut of parliamentary positions
daring to carry out an evaluation together on the basis of correct data that in my opinion is the right way
for this reason i believe the report is a result of excellent team work and i congratulate mr vakalis and all the colleagues who participated in this report
we recently experienced the lack of agreement in the un security council
thank you commissioner for that answer

but one of the most serious aspects is the fact that it leaves the whole question of liberalisation of planting rights from 2013 open although the rapporteur recognises that this will only serve to concentrate production in the hands of the biggest winegrowers who already enjoy the benefit of substantial public aid and other privileges
with regard to the european union s external action category 4 new needs are clear and cannot be met by previous reductions in commitments either through cuts in appropriations committed or through delaying payments as is happening now
we hope that we will have the funds also for those areas that were cut so seriously in december
with the necessary positive attitude i believe we can succeed in solving all these problems one by one and if both our parliament and the us congress make a contribution a good outcome is possible
i greatly regret that it has gone unheeded because the war on moneylaundering cannot be waged with a vague instrument that will only result in inefficiency and dissipation of effort

under these conditions talk about an employment strategy is nothing but pious hopes
this is the whole point of the new council regulation which concedes our customs duties on bananas sugar and rice for the 48 least developed countries

an existing network called safeseanet provides a means of exchange enabling all member states to talk to one another and exchange information
our interests are that these discussions meet with success as soon as possible but the leaders of the ukraine have to understand that ties between their country and the european union will only be strong if the ukraine finds its way back to the path from which the recent crisis has diverted it

i spoke in favour of creating an opportunity for business to reduce costs which would not be regulated in detail but fund managers with one language in this case english speakers should not receive priority and a competitive advantage

we are not trying to ignore that
i am counting on the full support of both arms of the budgetary authority so that europe can swiftly provide the necessary aid to farmers particularly those in africa in close cooperation with the competent multilateral organisations
we are confident that these countries can make them so that the deadline can be met

the average age of farmers in europe as you know is about 50
therefore parliament and the schmid report are fundamental to greater awareness of this issue
it was at this point that great controversy erupted with the council and the commission initially contending that parliaments demands lacked any basis in law
there is a general lack of such treatment in the developing countries
these negotiations have produced results

at a time when in the usa for example the public audit authority is being strengthened as compared to private auditors as a result of scandals such as the one surrounding enron it is clearly an advantage to have a public auditor who is obliged to remain independent

transparency and open dealing must be paramount and this report must and will be dealt with when the judicial process is completed

secondly in proportion to the entire economic stimulus package relatively little funding will be devoted to strengthening alternative supply routes
the commission is providing financial assistance for the startup costs and will examine how best to provide further infrastructure and targeted support

the report we have here has considerable impact
mr president honourable members i am pleased that it appears that the draft regulation on pesticide residues in food and feed can be adopted at second reading
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned
we also know however that what is described therein is a compromise and not moreover one reached on the lowest common denominator
it is for that reason that i am appealing to all those who may perhaps still harbour doubts to play their part in helping us tomorrow to achieve a result that will lay a foundation one on the basis of which political parties can be funded one that will make the future continuation of this work possible
ill treatment of romany people too continues to offend which is why the decade of roma inclusion launched by six heads of state and government is so important
i am proposing this in an oral amendment and i hope the political groups will see fit to endorse it
a501682002 by mrs cerdeira morterero on the initiative of the kingdom of spain with a view to the adoption of a council decision on the settingup of a network of contact points of national authorities responsible for private security 51352002 c500522002 20020802cns
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the report by mrs cerdeira morterero on family reunification was adopted by the committee on citizens freedoms and rights justice and home affairs against the votes of the group of the european peoples party christian democrats and european democrats which considers the report to be utterly unacceptable
the first debate will be on the structural funds particularly with regard to the preaccession phase and payments including the ispa
i believe that president bush is right to call for a un resolution on this subject now
the vote in favour by the members who have signed the report before is naturally based on the definition in article 2
prior to that consent the user or subscriber has to be informed of the types of data processed the purpose and duration of the processing and whether the data will be passed on to third parties for the purpose of the service
indeed institutional investors should explain to their clients why they are investing in noncompetitive type b companies rather than in a competitive type a company

the extent and the severity of our concern is reflected in the growing number of statements published also by the european union since the june debate eight more to date
we also want to promote dialogue at international level especially between the european union and the countries with which we have fisheries agreements
the debate is closed
in march 2006 we compared the roaming prices to their level of autumn 2005
the new rules are to enter into force within six months
demand for food products is exploding prices are rising fast and becoming unaffordable for those most hard up and at the same time agricultural land is disappearing
according to certain indices the surveillance system has not only been used for industrial espionage but also for intercepting the communications of individuals or organisations
in other words it is an experiment that has been judged useful as a model
mr president like those fellow members who have spoken before me i approve the principle of competition policy reform proposed by the commission
let us then be careful with assertions about there having been enough talking i believe we still have some way to go before we have convinced those who need to be won over if difficult decisions are to get majority backing
we must remember the horror that occurred when the insane ideas of two tyrants subjected the peoples of europe to mass murders people slaughtered in death camps and the distortion of destiny blackening the pages of europes history
the fact that the number of beneficiaries has expanded will also have to be taken into account
for our part we will endeavour to exert as much pressure as possible as regards four issues which we consider to be extremely important
i have therefore proposed to my political group the group of the european peoples party christian democrats and european democrats an amendment to the budget in order to allocate one million euros to studying a viability plan for implementing this strategy and i ask parliament to give it the green light so that all community citizens wherever they are receive the message that the european union is supporting them and above all protecting them
other actors are trying to get seats on that board so there is some pressure
overall it will help to protect the environment from climate change
but i want to highlight one thing and i hope commissioner nielson will take note of this
we call for the enforcement of the habitats directive and for the proposed natura 2000 sites to be adopted immediately and for resources to rehabilitate areas of unspoiled nature the coasts the seascape and marine life
reducing harmful alcohol consumption has in recent years become one of the priorities of health and social policies throughout the world and the european union is playing its part here too
very careful thought shows that there is no nonworking time but rather time for personal life in addition to family life that we have been wrong to identify the new frontier in social conflict as a conflict between insiders and outsiders that the relationship between flexibility and security is a twoway relationship and includes the needs of employers and the needs of workers that extending rights is an action that must not be so many words on a piece of paper but that requires change and transparency action against undeclared employment a coordination of policies and renewed vigour in harmonisation towards the goal of european employment law
most of the oil imported by developing countries is used for transportation the commissions statement makes hardly any reference to the transport sector
we have our commitments towards the acp partners in the cotonou agreement to maintain their tariff preferences
the ais is also there for the benefit of fishing vessels improving safety for these vessels too
it seems to me that many employers still have not even realised that they too are expected to show flexibility and make changes
in fact this 45 only represents 3 of the public budgets of the union and the member states
liberalism could have advantages to offer in some sectors but only if it is managed and regulated
we need to make sure that this does not happen as it really eats away at people
since 1996 the commission has been active in the fight against illegal content such as child pornography or racist content as also in the protection of children from accessing legal but harmful content such as adult pornography violent content and gambling
let us not forget as i said earlier that ratifying a treaty is a constitutional process and that in each member state therefore there is a need to sense what is appropriate and to determine the ways in which the commission is to intervene by means of european public funds
the commission would prefer the wording of its initial proposal which did not allow such exemptions
instead it fits in with the latest proposals put forward by the french finance minister mrsarkozy the implementation of which would be a particular blow to the economies of the new member states
mr president this debate on mrs morgantinis report is about the link that we need to make between trade liberalisation economic growth and poverty
the commission has been providing humanitarian aid to eastern chad since 2004 and aid in 2007 totalled eur 30 million
some of us are too
the adoption of mr rothleys report on the fixing of book prices puts a temporary end to what is sometimes a very unwelcome development
we cannot continue discussion on this matter indefinitely
we also need to think of the families of the defenceless victims of terrorism in recent years and of the millions of citizens who are still living under the threat of attack
therefore tomorrow we would be very much in favour of postponing by a month acceptance of the report that contains the part about coaches and deal with it later in june when it is fully ready
the most badly affected states should defend these means and pursue them jointly
it was in 2003 that mr garcamargallo y marfil wrote his previous report on the economic guidelines and now three years down the line judging from the place which the environment occupies in economic policy it seems that cooperation by means of the opencoordination method has failed to make the necessary impact
applause
europe needs clear objectives and strategies
we already have total bans in ireland and the united kingdom the whole of the united kingdom
the additional money for energy and research and also for decommissioning the kozloduy nuclear power plant in bulgaria are positive aspects but what i take issue with are the broad lines of the eu budget
absolutely not
if a project in which road haulage companies are included is good it must be possible to apply for aid for it
in this case we must use the funds for measures within the european union and for cooperation with third countries and when we talk about the level of emissions we must take into account our responsibility for global emissions currently running at 13 to 14 per cent and also add to this our historical responsibility for emissions
the fact that we have put forward a candidate signals europes commitment to promoting and strengthening human rights the rule of law and democracy wherever they are violated
we have achieved this ourselves in our committee and i attach great importance to this
there is something not quite right here
mrpresident after this debate parliament has the opportunity to demonstrate that it is not a puppet of the council and the commission
finland hopes that enlargement will be discussed at the summits though not turkish membership or the position of cyprus
that will ensure that the decisions made are rigorous right and fair
by seeking to spread the blame to criminals generally for the monstrous murder of robert mccartney the guengl resolution and the amendment by the vertsale group naively allows sinn féin and the ira to wash their hands of the known complicity of the members of the ira before during and after the murder and should not therefore be supported by this house
it is not like what happened with bse we have done our duty by our neighbours
one member state has said no we are listening and indeed we have to listen
the overall appropriations allocated to fisheries over the years must be considered a negative development given that previous budgets already represented the minimum necessary to implement a common fisheries policy and a maritime policy with the requisite resources
i am pleased that the fiori report specifically recognises this
thirdly we have given the package of pilot projects and preparatory measures which was agreed between all the groups and has already been evaluated by the commission a range of impulses for new policy elements new community actions and possibly new legislation
this permanent dialogue as highlighted once again in this chamber between mr trichet mr almunia mr juncker and mr barroso is strictly speaking contrary to the maastricht treaty itself
no one is sure who the attackers were even the government of omar el bashir came under suspicion
i think commissioner and i assume you are in agreement with me on this that the role of the european union in the international organisation must be strengthened
our purpose was not to prevent the house from addressing another issue but to put russia on the agenda
the report cannot address all political considerations
the study to which i just referred counted 120 plant species 70 species of vertebrates and 160 species of invertebrates in traditional olive groves in the province of cordoba in andalusia
p
es mr president i would like to begin by congratulating mr diamandouros on his detailed report which proposes a way forward and improvements in the relationship between the citizens and the european administration
we are in search of projects to be truly comprehensive that make europe more visible make it a global actor and influential in dealing with the global challenges that await us whether they be the fight against climate change or matters of development or the strategic balances with our other partners
this report does just the opposite
is it going to relieve poverty
educational provision for the roma implementation of specific employment policies guaranteed access to health services and last but not least promoting the battle for equality for roma women must be the means used to resolve in the long term the issues affecting this section of european society
de mr president as we know a fair amount has happened since animal protection as a concept was born as a result of increasingly mechanised animal breeding in the 19th century
i therefore support openness but i do not think that it is realistic to insist on openness on the part of coreper
we therefore agree with the commission on the need to have a mechanism that ensures that fishing opportunities are not put at risk as stated in article 12 if the process of ratifying a fisheries agreement has not been completed
that further distorts the market
it is becoming more and more apparent to us that the european unions potential for growth is not being exploited to the full that we are insufficiently prepared for demographic change and that we have not yet made full use of the opportunities that globalisation is presenting to our continent
the vote will be taken today at noon
what is of concern is who took the decision and why
we time it up here and he started at 1832
we have absolute confidence in our proposals which were adopted by all members of parliament from all member states
i also expressed the hope that there would be a wider spectrum of candidates than in the past for the forthcoming parliamentary elections
let me reiterate by way of conclusion my warm gratitude for your cooperation on matters relating to enlargement for your houses calm attitude consistently helps to keep enlargement policy rational and i look forward to our continued cooperation in future on the various projects that we still have to sort out together
the union must consequently play a key role where cuba is concerned
future enlargements and cohesion vote
i believe your work has become a quite central building block for the further development of the european union and i hope that it will continue as it has begun
on behalf of the pse group pt mr president i should like also to welcome the president of the council and the commissioner
like many who survived the blast the united nations itself carries deep wounds
there must be clear rules about this
in europe we must protect our quality wine and we must also address the issue of producing quality wines at an affordable price
9
by contrast the european initiative for democracy and human rights a rather smaller fund aimed at the exsoviet bloc which i had the honour to set up a few years ago amounts to only eur 106 million
countries which have voluntarily done more are at a huge advantage under the new system because the fisheries effort allocated to the individual member states in the future can then be allocated to the fleet in a way which makes greater economic sense and will not result in any one particular ship being given enough days at sea to be able to fish sensibly
using energy sources from the caspian sea region and making the most of the black seas strategic location are an essential condition for guaranteeing the european unions energy security
as we know currently there are people who have for some reason felt the issue of europe to be alien to them and europe has even seen growing exclusion
having said that i am convinced that this activity this component of cultural cooperation deserves significant support
present transparency requires iran to ratify and implement as we have said many times the additional protocol
only when any of the members concerned deny that they have the political affinity declared by the group is it necessary for parliament to evaluate whether the group has been constituted in conformity with the rules
in writing i voted in favour of this report which aims to create millennium development goal contracts between the eu and certain countries
in that respect people naturally look to the european union
the questions that have not been taken due to lack of time will be answered in writing see annex
could you promise that you will come up with a proposal shortly
i agree with the rapporteur that linguistic and cultural diversity influence the everyday lives of citizens in a significant way
like the others this innovation is part of an institutional package which as mr giscard destaing said certainly leaves room for improvement although it would be extremely dangerous to attempt to modify it to any great extent for fear of upsetting the balance of a complex system based on the dual legitimacy granted by national states and citizens as achieved in the convention
first a european roma strategy should be created as soon as possible and should primarily focus on improving the living conditions of the roma in europe creating jobs for the almost 90 of roma who are jobless combating antigypsyism supporting the education of roma bringing health into roma houses and promoting roma political inclusion
this means ensuring that the member states can resort to article 30 of the trips agreement in their national laws on patents in order to authorise production and exporting to tackle the public health needs in importing member countries
on the basis of the letter from commissioner patten could i ask you to consider the vote on the sab 4 as an urgency so that we can adopt it during this partsession
we have different vehicle and road safety standards in the uk we have a geographical seclusion we have a particular tax system which is different to some others and there are employment concerns these are issues also to take into account
at the same time it is very clear that there are differences between different member countries because there are different sourcing strategies for the companies concerned
rapporteur fr mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i should firstly like to thank in particular the secretariat of the committee on transport and tourism for its excellent preparative work and its work in consulting the interested parties in the context of this important matter
the priorities of your presidency will allow europe to meet the major challenges that it faces while preparing for the issues of the future
that is why it is also so important for the necessary structural reforms which the commission and the european central bank have repeatedly called for in the past actually to be pursued in the individual member states
the european court of justices ruling in the ferring case is a workable basis on which to evaluate state aid and public services
the threat of largescale fires has not gone away it is still present
secondly we must outline a mechanism of interaction between national and european level economic strategies
a third example is nuclear safety for that we are proposing eur 25 million
we do not yet have any final data for 2005 but i expect no greater reduction for that year than for 2004
at the same time it is also important that we keep the accession negotiations alive and we make practical progress with them because what the nationalists really want in turkey is to cut the accession negotiations
es mr president the proposal that we are debating today is unacceptable
i am very pleased that on this auspicious occasion the results of our collaboration also allow us to finalise the details regarding the seventh framework research programme
to give the commission carte blanche to reallocate fishing opportunities beggars belief especially when fishing opportunities are scarcer
that is one thing we are concentrating on
in order to prevent disruption to support for this sector an extension was approved for the improvement plans for the year 2000
the name has been changed
this is something we are looking at and we have proposed some measures to this end
these payments would be linked to the price of fuel oil
they are not going for prohibition pure and simple but are trying to prevent the harm caused by drug abuse with the use of clever methods
member states have committed themselves through the adoption of the european youth pact in 2005 to devote more attention to the integration of young people into education employment and society overall but the initial very promising progress has been stalled because of the current economic crisis
honourable members will have their own answers
mr president on 10 april we debated the gonzlez lvarez report on ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin
at the same time all hamass financial lines need to be severed
the antigrassroots common agricultural policy is the consideration for promoting the objectives of the european union to liberalise the markets in nonagricultural goods and services in order to safeguard jobs in the imperialist pyramid
the answer this gives us by default a europe shrouded in fog and in words left unsaid a coward that submits to the law of the strongest is in many respects quite dismaying
beyond the letter of the agreement however our intention through this agreement is to maintain constant cooperation in parliaments legislative actions which must take the form of a clear strategy and better results
i would like to thank parliament for treating the commissions proposals for revamping the fund with such speed
the minister said that she needs to make inquiries before giving an answer
workers reject the european oneway street and its supporters and also the lisbon strategy and the lisbon treaty and are fighting against emu and the eu itself for grassroots power and a grassroots economy
a good compromise serves our citizens better than postponed debates that do not lead to any kind of regulation
if peoplesmugglers are already being paid huge sums of money by those who want to enter the european union illegally risking their lives in the process it is easy to imagine the sort of money that will soon be changing hands to enable people to enter the eu quite legally as socalled partners
it is our childrens and grandchildrens interests
it is also obvious that the countries which opened their labour markets to citizens of the new countries have really only benefited while the transition periods encourage illegal work unfair working conditions discrimination against and exploitation of migrant workers
in reality we all know that the scale of the migration phenomenon exceeds the capability of the countries concerned to control these events individually and that a global and coherent approach is therefore needed at european level as the report rightly states
the proposal before us simply consists of codifying all existing community legislation in this area in order to ensure greater clarity and better understanding of the legislation
this is subject to a technical debate
forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting see minutes
surely we have seen enough violence and heartbreak in this region of the world not only have hundreds of thousands of lives already been lost but the social fabric of darfur is also being utterly devastated so the task of reconstruction becomes more problematic from day to day
such a remembrance in my city padua in my region veneto will breathe life into the creation of a remembrance museum in villa venier in the municipality of vo euganeo
following on from its communication the commission also adopted an annual report which is more political while it too points to the work done over the course of the last year it also seeks to identify priorities for the application of community law and a programme to put these priorities into practice
in my view this compromise is therefore the worst sort of hypocrisy whereby it is permitted to make nutrition claims for food with high sugar salt or fat content as long as the high content of these substances is indicated on the label
in order to achieve this last goal it will also have to provide protection for dealers and encourage the small and mediumsized businesses operating in the european automotive sector
as you said mrs dati mr barrot the idea has just been put to us in this report that we should make a considerable effort to mutually recognise authentic acts
i now wish to turn to the issues on which we are deeply divided
for that reason it should be the primary objective of the new century that we use that influence to ensure that there will no longer be any wars or conflict
it is not about washing ourselves but not getting wet
man can destroy much faster than build
various measures are proposed in the report such as education euronews and the creation of a museum of eu history
of course once you have taken this decisive step and we hope the council has followed your example we will not have a real assistants statute
i know that this is a particular concern of this parliament
subject mobile termination tariffs
a stronger set of priorities on the other hand would make us a constructive partner for the council particularly at a time of economic crisis when member states are experiencing shortfalls and are having to make drastic cutbacks
our house has decided and that now gives legitimacy
i am concerned however that there is a risk of a gap in control arising
as you all know it is essential to provide all political candidates with equal access to the media
when the member states of the eurozone decided to appoint a stable president of the eurogroup i expressed my great satisfaction
there can be no deadlines
it is important for the dialogue to be in place but at the same time for us to clarify our values
no mode of transport should be excluded from the programme
we must make the most of them
even in ireland unscrupulous employers have used the lack of free movement of workers in the eu to introduce discrimination as regards salaries and working conditions based on nationality
otherwise the public will not understand why we are voting on a text tomorrow that is already useless because there is an agreement outside parliament
we need to combine it with other points
it is difficult to believe advice concerning enlargement that comes from someone with as little knowledge of other member states such as poland which has been a member state for two years
because we are a polyglot multilingual union there must be speedy clear and accurate translation of the courts judgments into all the languages of the european union in order that citizens and their legal advisers throughout the european union are uptodate on the law of this union and how it is properly interpreted
this meeting allowed us to set out a common vision for europe in space built around the three principal actors of european space policy the union the european space agency and the member states while recognising the unions increased responsibilities
even the compromise designed to tone things down does not bring about any improvement
looking back over the past 10 years france the netherlands and now ireland twice have all voted to put the brakes on greater european integration and yet the eu has completely ignored their opinions
and this government has continued to remain in power
fourthly the commission shall not refuse to transmit applications to the authorising authority without having given the member states the opportunity to submit their observations
applause
the coming association council with turkey on 26 june will also cover human rights issues
this will contribute to transparency and to political clarity and the readiness to make decisions
there are other ways of tracing the origins of honey as well as the pollen content to which the rapporteur has referred
having said that i must admit that the opinions of our institutions legal services have opened some doors
within the ten priorities we refer to there is the question of lifelong learning and a proposal for a quantitative target for each countrys investment in lifelong learning in relation to total labour costs
truly harmful substances
ladies and gentlemen commissioner i would really like to congratulate everyone sincerely on a report which we can indeed call a report for the people of europe
i do have one piece of good news however the problems can be mitigated
this directive amended by parliament modifies integrates and completes the legislation that currently governs quality and safety standards in europe for the collection testing processing storage and distribution of human blood and blood components
italy and france are going to establish such limits i recall a draft law i submitted to the chamber of deputies together with the local communities and communicate them to europe so that europe can modify the transeuropean transport network and specify the changes in the commission s white paper which will also cover vehicle transit through the alps
the events that led to robert mccartneys murder show clearly the collusion that occurred
first of all as i told you it is making the issue of the emancipation of women their human rights and their health an integral part of any political and strategic dialogue it conducts with the partner governments
with regard to the guidelines by country these are now clearly structured in accordance with the great specific economic policy challenges of each country
my final point is that the use of caged beds in some of the existing member states is definable as inhumane and i hope to take that topic up with you personally as well
then there is the dilemma of the pharmaceutical industry which has meanwhile developed drugs that have reduced the number of deaths from aids in europe and the us by 75
i have no time for those who mutter that it is all hot air and will evaporate tomorrow
you listen largely to yourselves while the commission pays for events thinktanks and movements in favour of the failed constitution
we have been working on this treaty for the reform of the european union for 10 years since the decisions were taken in nice and we want to be able to take the final difficult steps so that this treaty can hopefully enter into force in early 2010
everyone also knows that twentyfirst century society has accumulated more than enough material and financial resources to provide this
i am therefore convinced that the longterm answer consists in promoting economic partnership agreements and in supporting the emergence of integrated regional markets which i might add can go hand in hand with a massive aid effort on the part of the european union in terms of bringing the qualitative standards of products up to the required level of technology transfer and of the construction of regional and subregional infrastructure of infrastructure to improve access and so on
we won some rounds in that battle over the european contribution at the monterrey conference
pt i fully agree with the content of this report because i believe it improves the text proposed by the commission and mainly because it focuses on a type of initiative that is becoming increasingly crucial and important such as the erasmus programme
this is the 29th presidency of the council that i have experienced and i must say without reservation that i have never seen such a convincing presentation of a programme and a european idea as this and i say that in all honesty
and fourthly i would like to state that despite the revision of the pact the commissions favouritism towards the largest member states has not changed
the progress is therefore evident
of course they will pass the cost on afterwards
we invest substantial resources in supporting movement of these countries not only to eliminate energy poverty but to power themselves with clean and new energy sources
our expectation is that both sides will abide by their public statements and the assurances given by them to the european union in order to prevent any further escalation of the crisis
i should like to make a plea here today for the promotion of more eurovision events through the medium of television
shortsea shipping carries 41 of goods traffic within the community
consequently different strategies and measures are needed to ensure the effective recovery of these stocks
so my message to both the commission and council is this let us stop the rhetoric and start to deliver
we can state unreservedly without any doubt at least on my part that the approval of this report would represent a european pact against terrorism
those who like mr eichel wish to muzzle the bundesbank fail to recognise the role played by an independent issuing bank and the importance of transparency for trust reliability and credibility
in connection with the financial perspective it is quite clear that the eus foreign policy was badly handled
i would emphasise in no uncertain terms how important it is for the work on this proposal to proceed swiftly
we who lived under soviet domination lived and experienced what it meant to construct fiveyear plans from gratuitous numbers
in conclusion i really must emphasise once again that in relation to the adventitious contamination of organic products by gmos the proposal under discussion at present amounts to a very important tighteningup of the rules and not as it has often been suggested a weakening
such a president also organise and plan for a longer period than just six months
i wish you luck commissioner
why though is it that nobody has thought of distinguishing between addresses by using numbers like telephone numbers for that would avoid internet piracy
if the current rigidity in relation to entry into the excessive deficit procedure is maintained the possibility of adjusting the deadlines once the country has been integrated into that procedure may be considered in order to conform to the treaty
those are broadly outlined in paragraph 7 very broadly as i think that they all deserve to be specified in greater detail
much of the hope awakened by zimbabwe has meanwhile been dashed
i think that we have not heard the last of this
i just wanted to take the opportunity to express my warm gratitude
as you know total eligibility for projects is going up from 50 to 75 and programmes in lifelong learning and research for the next seven years will both see a very substantial increase in their budgets for the 20072013 period
the prevention of a vote on the oral amendment moved by mr szjer provides abundant proof that the true objective of the resolution was not to show concern for freedom of the media
that is what is expected of europe it has its values it is tolerant it must demonstrate its determination perhaps such a meeting has already been arranged
cuba is the only caribbean and practically the only developing country in the world with which the commission has not been able to sign a cooperation agreement
mr president i would like to ask the presidentinoffice of the council mr bot what has happened to him in the space of a week
we therefore need just as with paper leaflets no thank you stickers
i am especially pleased that we were able to reach a consolidation 20 of the direct costs in our talks with the council and the commission
there is a lot of land in the european union that is not being used therefore much of this land could be used for producing biomass not only for biofuels but also for producing heat for cooling or for producing electricity
it was also suggested that if we did have a shortage of supply that this could be replaced by imports but i have to point out that the imports will be from remunerated sources so this undermines the very purpose that people wish to achieve
we believe that an independent and functioning judicial system is vital
on what was said about involving parliament more closely when making political promises i understood that to mean that parliament should be involved more before making political promises otherwise i do not see why we need to discuss it
the number of flights which was originally three per day has been cut down to two
in fact it would be right and proper for this award to be named after mrsmercouri who was then the greek minister for culture since this is what greece and mrsmercouri deserve
two years after that deadline it had to be recognised at johannesburg in 2002 that this commitment was a long way from having been met despite the efforts of the world bank in particular
eu food is distinguished by its high quality and correspondingly high standards
rapporteur fr mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen allow me first of all to warmly congratulate the council the commission and the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation on this dossier of amendments regarding marketing authorisations for medicinal products
however it is now time to take a step forward by also supporting the daphne iii programme which has financed 14 fgmrelated projects to date and by outlining the priorities for the prevention and elimination of fgm in europe
ultimately by means of the amended base regulation which applies to all the member states we want parliamentary assistants to be given the right as migrant workers to be able to choose to be governed by the legislation of the country that is most relevant to their work which is divided between brussels strasbourg luxembourg and the country of origin of the member of the european parliament for whom they work
the maastricht treaty was approved but no political europe was created
we need a flexible system to manage fish stocks and the opportunity to react quickly
for example last year the league of european research universities presented a study which concluded that the plan for the european institute of technology was misconceived and doomed to failure
however we realise that simply creating this position certainly does not achieve commonality on foreign security and defence policy issues
the debate is closed
the day before yesterday the wrote the real problem is not the supposed dependence of the judiciary but on the contrary its almost complete independence from all means of control
greece is one of the countries which recently pushed through special legislation supposedly designed to fight terrorism and organised crime
we call for more funds to strengthen womens rights and equal opportunities in general
20
second we need to introduce testing of honeys imported from third countries
we cannot conceive of it failing to do so
madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent report
this directive provides important safeguards against the misuse of data
that is most particularly the case where the use of quotas is concerned
commissioner the commission indeed presented a very ambitious financial framework
the free elections two years ago in ethiopia were a time of hope
fr madam president as mr parish has had to leave he has asked me to state our position on the amendments which reached us at the last minute
we are also opposed to the proposals which advocate the use of european taxpayers money to market wines in third countries
i would like to ask parliament to try with the commissions help to find common ground with the council on this dossier as quickly as possible
the swedish presidency aims to have it adopted by the council before the end of june
that is not the first question that must be raised but what is is our compassion for the victims and so it was a mistake on the part of the dutch presidency of the council to start by demanding reports from the scene on information policy and everything else rather than making it an absolute priority to express concern at the dimensions terror was taking on
one cannot ignore however their very real and positive benefits in terms of reducing substantially the annual human death toll due to accidental fires
the process for granting authorisation varies enormously at an intrastate level across the member states of the european union
in attempting to assess any type of situation one tends to forget what the starting point was
this resolution contains a number of very interesting points and the commission has taken careful note of them
it is above all this last point which as you know presents the most difficulties in our discussions with the united states
on the one hand there was the exceptional nature and unusual importance of the legal instruments upon which we were working
all of this goes against the constitutional objective of rehabilitation and social reintegration of prisoners with a view to achieving a fairer and more civilised society
because the badly needed elections in kosovo are elections for democracy not for terrorist organisations like the kla
i am sure you will understand that in such a case the players would be unpleasantly surprised and taken aback
it is no good being in the audience
above all else parliament aimed to prevent the donation of cells and tissues being commercialised and to a large extent we have succeeded in achieving this important objective
peoples lives do not wait we have to take decisions today
they will provide us with healthy citizens who do not fear illness
we have a plethora of instruments at our disposal
sometimes we also overestimate our own ability to cope with this transformation
but this is no time for complacency
experience to date has illustrated the opposite the markets have been shared out profits have increased for companies and prices have increased for the workers
that is how i see that the best results could be achieved
for if as appears to me votes are being as it were immediately corrected by the authorities i find that not exactly in order
in this context i recall the study the economy of culture in europe made in 2006 by a private consultant kea european affairs that presents some impressive numbers for the cultural sector however these numbers are debatable since mp3 players mobile phones and publicity are also considered by this study as culture
in any case we think this is a good basis for continuing our work in the year to come
we have different answers across europe

the internet is more than just a copying machine or a channel for the illegal dissemination of films or music
it is only in tanzania however that they are treated so cruelly

if people are going to be interested in europe they have to know about it
i should like above all to make a general appeal for us to avoid a repetition on the sea bed of the dramatic situations we have seen over recent decades with regard to the fishing of cod and other pelagic species
all these cases were very interesting and they helped us a lot
under pressure from the european parliament the commission has also drafted clear proposals for simplifying administration and in particular it has introduced a clear degree of flexibility that will now enable everyone drawing down money from the structural funds to transfer resources between programmes and even to use these resources to cover loans which is especially important for new member states
in terms of commitments i believe we have been very prudent in allowing significant margins in the various parts of the budget well under the ceilings provided for in the iia and for the first time since 2000 we are not requesting the flexibility instrument
i therefore welcome this proposal for a directive targeting n1 vehicles and i welcome mr goodwills report
we also need tolerance so that we are prepared to listen to what different people have to say
direct pressure on independent media has been growing in ukraine making it extremely difficult for the electoral process to be covered by a pluralistic and independent mass media
i think that if international legitimacy is established and the iraqis are enabled to share responsibility for what happens to them we in the european union will be able by means of common action to make what is in fact an important contribution todays debate has shown that the great political and national differences of the past are no more and that we all agree in principle on the same objective that of seeing this country rebuilt
mr president some of the previous speakers have pointed out that without parties there is no democracy and to that i have to add that there is no democracy without gender equality
thirdly i believe that we must rethink our entire system of public spending and revenue in order to make our economies more productive so that we have more resources amongst other things in order to meet social welfare spending needs

i wish to thank mr brie for the commitment and enthusiasm he has invested in this report and would appeal to him not to withdraw his name from it because he did a very good job of work along with the other shadow rapporteurs and myself
this is still unfortunately the familiar pattern in many african countries and we do not really know how to deal with it
how reliable are doublehulled ships
i support all the articles of this regulation and i voted for the motion but i must express my great disappointment as representative of pensioners throughout europe at the fact that with amendment no 55 which we adopted we are preserving the total ban on people with disabilities throughout europe travelling in europe travelling outside the borders of their own state and taking up residence in another european state because in so doing they would lose a large part of the allowances on which they depend to live
it is envisaged that a provisional report on these activities will appear at the end of 2003

as i pointed out to commissioner borg only last month we must pay particular attention to our international moral obligations to africa
lets not forget that in iran young people under the age of 18 years are subject to the death penalty although the international rights acknowledged under signature by iranians do not allow such atrocities
it would certainly be very nice to hear her speak at times in the beautiful sardinian language since i am sure she knows it
we propose commissioner to hold in reserve the bulk of the appropriations requested on passengers rights
there is an attempt to exploit the essential goal of restricting emissions of pollutants in order to divide the markets and limit the growth of the emerging new powers china and brazil which are claiming greater shares of the market
part i
the commissions proposals for next years budget are well below of the resources provided for in the financial perspective
progress was made last year in this field and the commission is currently working on further improving the effectiveness of the pacts preventative arm
that was the reason they were dealt with in a different context in the data protection directive and in this directive

i am speaking to you today at a time when the term of office of the first members of the european parliament to be elected from latvia is drawing to a close
the belgian presidency would be doing itself credit by bringing this affair to a successful conclusion however commissioner you have just told us that proposals will be forthcoming before the summer

the best security shield is the battle against poverty

no comment

that document mentioned how the transition to lowcarbon economies would have an important impact on employment
mr president in this debate on a point of order the term nationalists has been used which does no justice to the arguments of the aggrieved parties
what needs to be said is that europe considers employment to be the basis of true democracy and social cohesion and that europe has its own concept of what constitutes normal work stable employment for an unlimited period protected by contracts and by the role of the trade unions and with a requirement for equal conditions for standard and nonstandard jobs as part of employment equality
looking at this document from the commission for example i see that they want to simplify the whole body of commercial and company law now i know as one of the legal affairs committees permanent rapporteurs on this area that many of the directives and regulations we have enacted on this were the result of highly complex negotiations and compromises and that there is in any proposal for simplification the inherent risk of pandoras box being opened and of the compromises arrived at after much effort ending up being once more open to question

consequently as the meeting in almaty approaches we will likewise work on the assumption that the matter at hand the subject of biosafety will be debated in the same spirit with a respect for the rights of the citizen
i believe that if parliament and the council can endorse the amendments so too can the commission
mr president the reflection period has been more like a paralysis period which is very reminiscent of the reaction of animals in the countryside when they are blinded by entirely unexpected glints of light
we are losing innumerable lives to illnesses caused by alcohol consumption and the number of victims of drinkdriving is also extraordinarily high in the member states
there is one on this issue
i would first of all like to point out that this is the second time that we have been consulted on this issue

the fact that the parliamentary bodies of my own country have also devoted attention to the interception of communications as evidenced in two belgian parliamentary reports which were sent to mr schmid and which are mentioned in his report reinforces my belief that the political issue involved is complex yet important
i hope to find this all in the resolution we will be voting on tomorrow
looking at the tough war on drugs waged by the usa i would say that this has done nothing to reduce the use of drugs but has only lined the pockets of the drugs barons
these two ideologies which were born at the same time divided europe among themselves with the hitlerstalin pact
when the hostages are released for our part we shall not forget what we am now stating particularly because we are aware of the difficult conditions in which the citizens of cabinda are living
all of this proves that european initiatives to combat climate change will continue to be in vain without comparable efforts from the americans the chinese and the other industrialised nations
remarkable things were said
finally it is a forward looking plan when we look at cooperation with the united states of america and other countries throughout the world to ensure that this new technology can be used for the benefit of all of mankind and not for those who want to avoid our legal structures
let me take this opportunity to mention a visit to this house on wednesday by a ukrainian woman who campaigns for human rights who will on that occasion be describing instances in which newborn children are taken away from their parents the suspected purpose of this being the transplantation of their organs or tissues
whatever their nationality or their administrative situation these people should be treated with the dignity that all human beings deserve
it is clear to us that we will emerge from this crisis by working together and that the biggest challenge that europe currently faces is to cooperate and to strengthen the economic unit that we have so that we will be able to support each other rather than weakening the union as is suggested
but what can we offer besides more rhetoric in this already overopinionated debate
now to the issue of staffing and personnel expenditure which was just raised by mrs buitenweg and mr escobar
mr president many thanks to mr andria for his report on the amendment of the regulation on the facility providing mediumterm financial assistance for member states balances of payments

the first year of activity of the human rights council has permitted us to ascertain whether in applying its planned procedures and mechanisms the human rights council will be able to implement the ambitious programme that it has adopted for itself
we are to complement member states and support them in their policies but that does not mean that there is no role for the european union as was reflected in the report and what members have said
mr president ladies and gentlemen in our opinion it would be a mistake to take the blinkered approach of looking at the issue of the protection of human rights solely in terms of the rights of individuals seeing them as the one and only matter of any significance to anybody and disregarding the rights of peoples their traditions and their cultural identities
similarly the meda ii regulation referred to the need to recognise and strengthen the economic and social role of women and to the importance of education and of the creation of jobs for women
therefore i hope that this strategy will improve step by step
but lawmaking especially at a european level is a process a lengthy process not an end point
i should also say that there has been an extraordinary mobilisation on the part of the institutions the government parliament all the opposition forces as well as the majority who with great wisdom and responsibility regard the work to be done in a spirit of unanimity local institutions volunteers civil protection the thousands upon thousands of young people and adults who went to abruzzo and who represent social groups associations and the catholic community everyone has made a contribution
in my view this will inevitably reduce the number of victims of accidents that occur in big cities where there is the greatest number of accidents and the greatest number of victims

the efforts of those who work with the roma and sinti communities to bring them out of a marginalised situation one of poverty and violence to women and children which is objective which exists which neither i nor any of us wish to deny is at an impasse and there is simply no way out if the situation remains as it is today
extension of the ban to include imports
the text is a legal translation of what was decided last september by the heads of state and government in relation to the socalled capping provision which is common to all structural instruments including the rural development fund and is also reproduced in the general regulation on the structural funds
the treaty must state clearly that firstly the union recognises the freedom of administration of the states and their authorities which includes their right to define and organise their public services and secondly that the funding offsetting the additional costs of successfully providing services of general interest is not to be deemed state aid
at the end of this legislative term i therefore address all those who are members of the committee on employment whatever side they sit on please make sure that this text can be applied immediately
madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the proposal for a regulation in question was examined in depth by the committee on legal affairs for which i have the honour of being the draftsman

instead of spending huge sums on the arms race and military operations money should be spent on education healthcare economic development and the fight to eradicate poverty
i will limit myself to two points
mr fini mr frattini we want the european parliament to have representatives i am deliberately avoiding the term observers at the intergovernmental conference who will have every facility afforded them to play their part in its work
i must point out however that better financing of rd and the creation of a new institution is not enough to ensure that europe becomes competitive and innovative
i am therefore first going to try to convince them of the necessity of preserving the transition process
this is very fine but life has sketched new challenges for us
with the advent of the mobile internet the costs and nuisance of unsolicited communications will therefore increase significantly
suspending the activities of newspapers is aimed firstly at hitting the newspapers economically
in fact the real objective is a pure and perfect cigarette market on a european scale a decompartmentalised market with a single tax where competition can run riot
as regards the internal political situation in chad a political solution to the argument is the only way to achieve peace and stability in that country
unfortunately due to the reprehensible shillyshallying of some member states these erika i and erika ii packages only entered into force this year and only on 23 july at that
the pollution caused by an accident involving a vessel transporting highly toxic chemicals can of course cause even more concentrated pollution if it happens on a river than might be case on the high seas
it is up to member states to improve the implementation of existing national legislation
both countries have done a great deal to improve things and they will continue to do so
to date no decisions have been taken on the matter but i am sure that the council will come back to the issue
that is heartening as the eus voice is immeasurably strengthened when its institutions speak with one voice
recently we extended it to cover other highlevel people
so we will support the amendments tabled by the vertsale group on this
that is why it is so important for us to support and back the numerous candidates in the communes for us to ensure that fair local elections are held for us to monitor efficiently for us to ward off prevent and correct any jiggerypokery during registration
in conclusion i would like to say to commissioner bolkestein that i hope he will accept this proposal from mr rothley on behalf of parliament and move as quickly as possible to bring these changes into effect in the form of further revisions to the motor insurance directive
it is important for me to take advantage of the 10th anniversary of this key event in european integration to pay homage in my turn to those men who created the euro such as pierre werner helmut kohl françois mitterrand jacques delors valéry giscard destaing and others
as i have said in committee meetings and recently i attended a meeting of the committee on the internal market and consumer protection it is important to realise that the previous commissions proposal was never going to see the light of day as it was drafted
they also work together in crisis management darfur in the sudan being one example
for this reason i can only partly accept amendments nos 68 and 71 and i cannot accept amendment no 69
i have to get something off my chest the rapporteur has made rather a hash of things
whereas money laundering is not exclusively linked to financing terrorism the truth is that this crime for real criminals plays a key role in financing terrorist activities
it was afraid of not getting approval from the council and now we are saddled with the problem
in writing sk this report has shown again that rule 452 has serious shortcomings
we need to cook afresh because if we just warm up a dish that no one can digest indigestion will result in it being rejected even more than the first time it was served

lastly several countries including ghana cameroon mali sierra leone and cote divoire have also included measures on the management of natural resources and governance of this sector in their national programmes for the 10th european development fund

i am thinking of the idea of value for money following on from criticism by the court of auditors and in costbenefit studies and other reports
the criminalisation of immigrants is a real scandal against people who are fleeing from political or economic oppression
i therefore feel it would be useful to make two things clear firstly that the member states are under an obligation to guarantee the universal service and funding for it whatever the circumstances and secondly that the member states must be required to get their house in order and to prepare for this new situation thoroughly and in good time
secondly the council will endeavour to monitor the implementation of the conclusions of the international conference in support of afghanistan the european union must play a key role in this respect given its financial contribution

mr president allow me to take up the various points which have been mentioned during this debate and to let you know the commission s position
i support this principle but the commission must ensure that the current problems with the audit arrangements at headquarters are not simply exported to the delegations
this is tantamount to blackmail and coming from a government that has imposed more than 80 stealth taxes from a chancellor gordon brown who has made taxation in the uk higher than germany or france and now wants us to believe that he needs to slash 25 off our farmers singlefarm payments in order to be able to afford agrienvironment schemes it is an absolute joke
there is one already
neither does it make much sense to vote on motions for resolutions related to the debate on the commission
as regards the modernisation of the fleet inland waterway transport must improve its logistical efficiency and its performance in relation to the environment and safety
the euro has pushed down inflation considerably and so created confidence and stability and it has become the second most commonly held reserve currency in a space of time that no one thought it capable of

this is the result of terrible battles purges and terror
mr belder asked about the remarks of our colleague and friend the dutch foreign minister about the palestinian authority in particular and the importance of ensuring that it operates in a more transparent and democratic way i have to say that what our colleague mr van aartsen said during his visit to the middle east was not just wholly in line with our views on the development of democracy in the palestinian territories but an extremely eloquent and effective exposition of our view as one would expect from him
anyone who had said 10 years ago that the euro would have developed as splendidly as it has done would have been laughed at
we need to distinguish between the suicide bomber and his or her recruiter
since the vote cast by the people of france and of the netherlands in 2005 that version of europe no longer has any democratic legitimacy

for parliament the erika iii package was always a package and never a collection of cobbled together measures
as a result this issue must also be taken into account and measures defined which can be applied equally to everyone so that governments do not have any excuse
i think we have gained time
thus instead of limiting ourselves to what is by now the tiresome exercise of blaming the european bureaucratic machine the socalled brussels eurocracy let us also take a little look at our national situations because if we more closely analyse the way in which our national public apparatus works and if we call on the governments to work together in improving their administrative performance then we might not have this figure of a eur 7 billion return next year
there is a negative mark in the ecological balance sheet namely the infrastructure costs directive
in particular i would like to emphasise the correctness of the decision adopted by the resolution to call the acts that unita has recently been perpetrating terrorist acts

this is an objective for the tibetans but also for all free men and women across the world

mr president as i said earlier in the debate and after consulting all the groups who appear to have given their agreement though this will have to be confirmed i would be happy to table two oral amendments which do not add anything new but which were forgotten in the haste with which our work was carried out
i can state that he starts precisely from the conclusions of the previous report by indicating that the salvation of the mountains we are all calling for can start from the farming sector itself
we therefore support the onesta report and would like to thank you once more for your constructive cooperation
mr president let me raise a few issues from the perspective of a new member state
at the parliamentary assemblys last session in kigali we called for prudence and the avoidance of hasty further regulation of relations between the eu and africa
is there no such will or is it a sense of realism that is inducing us to refrain from tackling these issues and to leave the text as it is
it should further update the existing policy where appropriate based on the experience gained since 2003 and adapt it to changed circumstances
i made sure the shadow rapporteurs were fully informed at all stages on the state of informal contacts with the council
we still need new legislation
following the debate in parliament the proposal has been reduced to 65 and i think this is a substantial step which genuinely facilitates use of the fund
we could imitate it
not just green certificates or trade but mutual growth jointly sharing the euromediterranean project we must think of the pockets of terrorism in mogadishu and the violence in zimbabwe that are preventing the development of democracy
i hope that parliament and the council will be able to come to an agreement rapidly
it plays an increasingly assertive role on the international stage
i would like to refer more specifically however to an issue that is very important and that cuts across everything we are talking about and which the president of the commission has not mentioned the need to redirect the doha round of development negotiations

the report before us on the other hand which we are now discussing is a very definite backward step a return to the stone age as it were of immigration policy
this is a report crucial to our way of thinking
that is also the reason why according to this house current information should be made available and symbols should be used which can be developed by the commission and are recognisable around the european union by all citizens
what we are considering is just in case there is no global agreement but the global agreement remains our goal and our priority
while the constitution does not in itself solve any problems it does provide us with the framework of legitimacy and decisionmaking competence that enable us to do so for ourselves and i hope that it is for this reason clear to all twentyseven member states and i am following the commission in saying this that they have to have very good reasons for not going along with that process and so we have to ensure the european union as a community of twentyseven faces up to this challenge rather than disintegrating into the little blocks that would result if it could not as a whole succeed in doing so
for two and a half years i have tried as chairman to help to bring to life a specific type of politics for europe
because each and every country is slowly waking up to the reality that one size does not suit all in the eurozone and neither now will one citizenship
once again we can vote on a possible oral amendment should this prove appropriate in a moment
the lower the tariff the greater the financial effort required to compensate european producers will be

mr president mr van den bos is to be congratulated on his work but the trouble with a wideranging report like this is that it eventually includes everyones pet hobbyhorse and the key messages may be obscured

the 1998 action plan of the united nations general assembly is another step in that direction and we have now reached midterm in the tenyear evaluation period defined at that time
what is required here is a balance
there are two other points that i want to make very briefly
mr president terrorism is the destruction of democracy
both the national study group and the presidential commission working in nigeria itself recommended that the death penalty be abandoned as it does not reduce crime
in particular it stresses the importance of environmental protection and the need to maintain natural beauty spots produce quality products and urgently maintain the cultural heritage
however that does not give us the 100 clarity we need at this very moment

under these circumstances an 18kilo box of bananas can be sold for usd 3 in germany
mr president with all due respect i cannot subscribe to your view
everything must be done in close collaboration with the italian authorities
on the one hand we are pleased with the efforts made by the commission during 2001 to integrate the aspect of equal opportunities between men and women into the unions policies and particularly into new fields such as international trade public contracts asylum policy and the environment
we must rationalise the use of the flexibility instrument which is governed by certain rules which must be respected for the sake of the credibility of our european union project in terms of the review of the coming financial perspectives surely we will be able to reach an agreement on the solution to this issue
fr mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen it is my turn to pay tribute to the imagination shown and the efforts made by our institutions in order to release via some budgetary techniques as mr lamassoure mentioned by some miracle the very substantial sums of money that correspond to the second phase of the economic recovery plan that is eur 2 400 000 000
the questions raised by the honourable member are extremely important but they are somewhat beyond the scope of this particular question
that is a good point
what pilot projects and training actions are scheduled to be carried out in 2008
i am grateful to the chairman of the committee on culture and education mrs pack who contributed a great deal on this issue
i would say to mrs maes in particular that one of the reasons the council and the commission have not wanted to take urgent action as some in this parliament would perhaps have wanted is the danger that what mugabe wants is an excuse to call a state of emergency in zimbabwe so he can cancel the election stop the democratic process and stifle the official opposition as well as any opposition from the press and media

i just wanted to know your opinion on the setting up of a formal structure for exchange of information with regard to health professionals in this case caregivers who cross borders
we are gravely concerned for the future of peace in our region as we hear about israeli projects that aim to draw the final borders of israel inside occupied palestinian territory
as we have just heard with china we have a factor which is set to use coal for about the next 50 years or so it is estimated for at least 60 of its energy requirements
but israel like any other country must recognise its international frontiers
unfortunately he is unwilling to listen to advice whether it comes from his own country or from abroad unless it is accompanied by concrete measures
after my stay in naples mr president i went to trieste where i took the train to go to another italian city
indeed many eu citizens do not and they support a total ban on the import of seal fur skins
no
but if we follow this path we can really guarantee that already in this generation we will have efficient affordable clean energy
it is therefore perfectly clear to me that what is currently going on in iraq is in contravention of item e of the council conclusions
i think i am out of sequence because the internal market was discussed earlier by some of my colleagues
in terms of relations with third states there has of course been the summit meeting with japan another one with russia and tonight and tomorrow of course one with the americans about which i am sure i will be able to say something more in the course of debate
concentrating on the plight of migrants traversing the mediterranean europe and the north african states maghreb have to work in unity
in europe we can see that russias policy on chechnya has failed
finally we have tabled two amendments about the exchanging of information and consideration of alternative methods
another positive aspect is that through helcom russia is also able to participate in the implementation of the baltic sea programme of measures without russias involvement it is difficult to protect the baltic and ensure good environmental status
major vaccination campaigns are needed
on the other hand we cannot always consider the economic crisis itself as an excuse for this predicament as airlines went bankrupt even before this crisis was unleashed
by increasing the conditions of entry for example for children and choosing between qualified and nonqualified jobseekers europe is becoming a fortress
we have prepared a report which raises the profile of the voluntary sector
mr president my concrete and direct response to a concrete question is to inform the honourable member that in cases similar to those he describes people can take their complaints to the commission
is the commission aware of these activities and are measures in place to counteract them
we need to invest through the sixth framework programme and other r and d funds balanced regulation is important
in portugal for example there is a danger that more companies may go the way of the former sorefame and the viana do castelo naval yards
the commission cannot accept amendments 12 13 15 24 29 39 40 41 42 and 46
the result will be a directive with great added value for european citizens and for the development of the information society
thank you commissioner
our legislative activity is a continuous process
a number of important issues have coincided i refer to the preliminary assessment of the most recent enlargement preparations for subsequent enlargements including the complex debate on turkish membership the initial assessment of actions ensuing from the lisbon strategy and preparatory work for the new financial perspective for 20072013
mr president there are only a few hundred hungarians living in latvia today but if we believe in humane minority rights however then we must also mention their deprivation of rights

he met the people living working and suffering there and his local experiences are integrated into the report
i believe that the rapporteur has covered all the main points as has mrs griesbeck with whose remarks i wholeheartedly agree
there is growing support in polish public opinion for aid to developing countries
the french presidency along with the presidency of the commission and the presidency of the european parliament need to take the initiative
this constitution cannot be a copy of any nationstates constitution
but it was only the second time since the committee on petitions was created that a resolution adopted by parliament resulted from direct complaints from citizens of the european union
however all the questions will receive a written answer so we will be able to fulfil our obligation
thank you mrpresident
those decisions will allow us to look more confidently to the present and the future im just finishing mr president and i believe that they will also make it possible to give a convincing response to legitimate european concerns
why did the council only come up with this plan at the very last minute in the summer while parliament was still to get started
now of course troubled waters is not set in the real world
that means that we as citizens now have the opportunity to ban this cruel trade
the same initiatives must also be taken by the european parliament
the promise of future consultation and feasibility studies is to be welcomed but this should not be an excuse for doing nothing
means of legal recourse exist that are sufficiently clear accessible and based on information that is clear and available in advance
i will mention a few of them does the report make sense is it useful are the points raised given adequate priority are they always confirmed what role is played by its main errors by the choice of press agencies and by the media
today we heard a detailed commission position on our proposals and we notice that the commission has kept its promise and remains very committed to supporting the line this house has taken
the results are posted on the internet for you to read any time you want
we are against these practices and assure you that we will remain vigilant and active in our efforts to ensure that all those who reside in europe can be full citizens and enjoy equal rights
that is why my group has decided to support the spirit of the resolution despite some of the wording and difficulties concerning the possible financial contribution from the union which is why we have asked for a separate vote on that issue
it has been a difficult passage but we have got through it and have obtained funding for reconstruction in iraq the maintenance of traditional geographical policies funds for smes information and research as well as resources for the agencies
yet if there is an area in which we need more from europe more restricting community regulations it is this one
so i would like to express my total and determined condemnation of this event which degrades the human condition in the extreme
as i have already said in this house a year ago iraq was the only arab country that was totally free of any trace of islamic fundamentalism
finally i want to express my full support for the report by mr staes on the discharge for the european parliament
some member states have agreed a text on the constitution for the future of europe and it is ultimately up to them to deliver on their agreement to make sure they convince their people
that violence includes a palestinian suicide bomb attack on a bus in jerusalem and a number of israeli attacks on members of hamas carried out in densely populated civilian areas
people have a spiritual need to create quite simply for the sake of creating
it remains a problem for parliament on how far individual countries should be named in this report
the whole area of innovation research and development is one that we talk about a lot but in which concrete legislative action to protect design patents and copyright and to allow for proper investment in research and development in financial terms is still lacking
we only regret that the report does not envisage a formal obligation for companies to grant their employees the necessary time in order to give blood and to remove the bureaucratic authorisation procedures that discourage those with good intentions
as a next step it is our intention to develop a road map before the end of this year containing concrete actions with firm deadlines in order to start putting a european information security policy in place
fr mr president taiwan is just now emerging from a dreadful natural disaster unprecedented in the country over the last 50 years
that altogether adheres to the spirit of our european institutions
we agree that resettlement programmes can be of great value especially when they cater for those most at risk in an already precarious situation that these programmes can be used within the european union to help develop a public understanding as to why refugees seek protection and that this understanding can help to combat all forms of discrimination not least racism and xenophobia
some of our companies have responded by developing new types of technical textiles for example a hinckley company developed special flight socks and a derby company developed special heatresistant clothing for use by firefighters
that being the case i believe that we should be able to reconcile matters and so conduct a campaign against terrorism with respect shown of course for the great values and the great principles which mean that we in europe attach much importance to the protection of privacy on the one hand and to the prevention of all commercial espionage on the other
we are going to look very closely at the application of this convention and then we are obviously going to incorporate this proposal in the framework of the stockholm programme
i believe it is exactly this type of initiative which is needed to focus attention on the acute nature of the current situation to clearly and objectively report to the people of europe what is happening
therefore because we must not only condemn such acts but must also take action we must realise that there is a risk of regressing by hundreds of years to a situation of an organised presence of criminal networks and pirates operating in four main areas the south china sea the straits of malacca and singapore the gulf of guinea and the horn of africa
all support to related social sectors such as investment in water and sanitation and budget support linked to improved health and education outcomes has to be taken into account
some progress has been made fortunately with a number of court rulings and this is important
however the way in which these services are paid for must be clearly regulated
we need a clear picture of the other measures that are planned towards this end and how they will combine to bring it about
i recognise that this is a difficult issue for some members and that paragraphs 37 and 38 of the report may seem to preempt the reconsultation process on the procedures directive in which we hope parliament will be involved very shortly
the proof is that you refer to a case that was in fact brought to our notice by our delegation
the amended text explicitly provides that the slovak republic may delegate the exercise of some of its powers to the european union through or on the basis of an international treaty
i would point out moreover that we are only talking about active plant
i think this sends out the right signal in connection with the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon
i speak of course with particular reference to the structural funds but i also have others in mind
this sound approach must be further developed
and i have had the opportunity to remind the new polish government that it will have to do so
what i also want to say with regard to this houses budget is that we have to reap the benefit of what we have achieved through the success of our building policy
the irony is that throughout this discharge procedure we have heard a lot of sound and fury from the right and the rightwing press and yet all they could muster after all that was three measly votes in committee
we cannot wait for guinea to descend into chaos with unforeseeable consequences for the region
this house should concern itself with its own affairs instead of judging standards in other countries especially ones that do not belong to the european union as such activities do not lie within its field of competence
if these amendments are defeated i urge voting against this report
it is also a fact that the socalled ira is the most active and politically driven perpetrator of violence and intimidation in northern ireland that it engages in widespread criminality in northern ireland in the republic of ireland and also in britain and does so to enforce its rule of law and to fund its activities
european standards should be created for this as quickly as possible to enable us to take the lead in the global market
nor do we share the view expressed in paragraphb of the draft report which calls on the commission to think twice before withdrawing 68 legislative proposals thought not to be in keeping with the objectives of for example the principles designed to produce better legislation
i am well aware that member states are conscious of the fact that delaying responses can facilitate their political decisions that is sometimes the case
please let me say one more thing mr president go to thessaloniki
therefore it is now possible to compensate for losses of bees and production by funding activities to promote queen production purchasing of bee colonies or even purchases of hives
it is my belief that support must also be given if political work is fostered by society rather than only by the state that is right and proper provided that transparency exists and controls are in place
with all due respect to those in europe who wanted to demonstrate that the opposite is true democracy has shown once again that freedom of information is alive and well in italy
we should remove the barriers facing citizens particularly in the new member states in relation to the free movement of people and services
the commission can accept amendment 33 in part
all kinds of cosmetic changes have been made in order to jazz up the proposal including the introduction of a new category of sufficient bathing water but that cannot take away the impression that there was little enthusiasm in the council for tightening up standards
thank you for that point mr swoboda it clearly is an exception
president sarkozy i would like to welcome you to the european parliament as presidentinoffice of the council
in writing pl as a member of the acpeu parliamentary assembly i wish to support the results of last weeks euafrica summit meeting in lisbon
we also support the mitchell report s proposal that israel should cease using live ammunition against demonstrators
it is clear that a priority project does not exclude continuation to other destinations
there is also a communication about this matter which you will be receiving
madam president ladies and gentlemen the agreement reached by the rapporteur mr zimmerling is a compromise agreement on an extremely interesting issue
we members of parliament are not normally late going to lunch but i wanted to explain why i voted against mrs nicholson of winterbourne s and mr schrder s reports
having said that if the house really does insist that we put this to the vote i would be quite happy to do so
it is stated that the contamination arose during a normal manufacturing process a process that also includes the refining of the oil
seen in this light the budget of eur 115 million granted for the year is at least not oversized
i think an information campaign on the negative consequences of this type of product would be very important
even so the ethiopian prime minister has been received in germany
in writing fr with todays vote the eu has provided itself with a text the scope of which is far from achieving the desired objectives
my special thanks and my acknowledgement go to the people in india to those who offered you protection and assistance despite the uncertain local situation
we adopted legislation to introduce doublehulled vessels a european fund for major oil disasters and ports of refuge and now we are revising and adopting legislation on the liability of carriers of passengers by sea the investigation of maritime accidents the community vessel traffic monitoring and information system port state control and lastly the regulation and directives on ship inspection and survey organisations
i would like to say in conclusion something about the euus summit
if the commission agrees to present the council with a proposal on enhanced cooperation within the sphere of rome iii however it may in the interests of legal clarity withdraw its initial proposal once the decision has been taken in order to amend it but that would only be if we really had the possibility of launching enhanced cooperation
what i say to you though has to do with the history of the european unions textile industry it is that we will still probably have to deal with protectionist measures or with the maintenance of protectionist measures on the part of the united states or of japan
in writing one of the great mysteries to the population of the european union is how we can devise a system that pays farmers for leaving land idle
9
we are not joining in the game therefore we are not dutifully delivering our opinion
the whole lot of them are however in agreement as to the direction to be taken namely ever more power to brussels
thus the national budgetary effort required to keep emissions within allotted limits will be charged to the budget for technological investment so creating an obstacle to meeting european environmental standards in economically disadvantaged areas
this is the directive on the free movement of citizens and there have been 1500 complaints by citizens but only 19 infringement cases have been opened
this price stability is an advantage for all european citizens it protects income and savings helps to reduce the cost of financing and encourages investment jobcreation and medium and longterm prosperity
i would really like to avoid a debate
i would just like to ask whether the council can attempt to investigate the conditions in which individual prisoners are held and how does it evaluate the developments in cuba as far as relationships with the european union are concerned
we could examine how existing funds could be redirected in order to get this globalisation fund off the ground
a coordinated european approach could finally give us greater leverage in negotiations with the united states over access to documents and transfer processes
this topic these people and their suffering is potentially the stuff of politics populist politics on the ground and as our debate here also shows sadly also of european populism
the question of the legal basis about article 37 or article 280 as proposed by us is of course not just an academic one
it should be borne in mind that this period will see the accession of at least two new member states and that the whole of the territory of the 12 new countries is eligible for support
therefore mr president moving beyond the parliamentary dimension of relations between the european union and the united nations which is necessary and correct it is important that we act in an agreed manner in a complementary manner and that the european union demonstrate clearly that its strength lies in its unity and its weakness in its fragmentation
if we want to increase our competitiveness to keep up with both america and asia we must find a solution to the structural tensions in european economies

fr the report is concerned about the rising budget deficit which after deducting privatisation receipts could reach 7 of gross domestic product in 2001 and therefore calls on the czech government to carry out urgently needed reforms to the healthcare and pensions system and recalls that budgetary consolidation must not be carried through in such a way as to compromise the midterm objective of social cohesion in accordance with the european social model in particular the fight against poverty and social exclusion
no amendments have been proposed
i then discover that people are opposed to this type of research
once again i am very happy to see this synergy between our european institutions the council parliament and the commission on this subject i believe mrs wallis that in line with your wish for us to be careful and not to limit our ambition but rather to apply it to ejustice the french presidency and mrs dati have demonstrated such ambition
i think they can

i therefore support the current diplomatic effort and believe that our best course of action would be to avoid a resolution that could compromise the success of any negotiations that might take place in the next few hours
it is a problem not just of the future but of the present
redundancies are one of the principal adverse effects brought about by the phenomenon of economic globalisation alongside the acknowledged benefits

we have managed to mobilise the flexibility instrument in the sum of eur 185 million and this is a new resource which is greater than the ceiling of the financial perspectives
never more so than at genoa has it been clear that similar displays of muscle and power on the part of the world s greatest nations are just cinema which certainly does nothing to alleviate hunger in the world or to enhance equality between peoples if it is not matched by practical action to cancel the debt redistribute wealth safeguard material rights and eliminate all exploitation of developing countries
this is where issues connected to overseas and development aid will of course be of correspondingly great importance
in writing whilst i agree with taxation on tobacco and a minimum tax across europe i abstained because of the damage it could do to the british tax on tobacco
with regard to the europol mandate it would make more sense if all this was established in general terms instead of legislation always being drawn up on a case by case basis
the international conference on population and development formulated a clear agenda on the fight against aids and in 2001 the un general assembly adopted a declaration of commitment on aids
they can only do it by agreement and by sitting down to reach that agreement

transport is one of the main sources of climate change road transport uses five times more energy than train transport for the same number of passengers
i have a few doubts about the text of article 2 which refers to a study by the world health organisation about the usefulness of alcohol in prevention of some diseases

roma like any other disadvantaged group may pay dearly as a result of the crisiss impact
so it will not be influencing or moving the mandate that we have already got
there are two main recommendations that to my mind emerge from this report the first relates to the need to ensure that the balancing of public finances is entirely compatible with the process of revitalising european competitiveness and that this process is pushed to the top of europes political agenda
we wish to express our sympathy and solidarity with mrs zavadskaya and her family at this very difficult time
europe is facing a huge economic crisis and must look for effective ways out of it

this is the basis of their confidence in the ombudsmans operations
on the basis of this composition which remains the same as before the presidencys statement the leadership of the group will schedule the meetings it considers appropriate in order to continue working within that group

for their part europes goals are attainable if they correspond to the vision of every member state
the programme of the french presidency of the eu is ambitious but it should also be aware of the expectations of the population
this satisfies the intention to press ahead with simplifying and clarifying community legislation in order to make it easier for everyone to access to understand and to implement it
as my colleague ms mcguinness has already said we saw at the world trade organisation talks how the commissioner is willing to sacrifice the interests of our farmers and our rural community not for the good of the third world but for part of an international bargaining game
in writing pl the success of microcredits in reducing poverty in developing countries particularly in southern asia and latin america has not yet taken hold in the eu

croatia cannot be lumped in with the rest of southeastern europe or with turkey either
however the unrest in fyrom has made it clear that there is a real need to improve the position and rights of the albanians and other minorities in the country
that is a voluntary agreement it is a memorandum of understanding whereby the mobile industry together with the gsm association of europe agrees to monitor publish and translate codes on their website both those which already exist and those which will be adopted
lastly i would like to point out that with regard to all these problems and i am coming to my conclusion mr president the commission is not shirking its responsibilities
mr lehne to whom i would like to pay tribute has certainly worked very hard as i did on a text that would have satisfied the pse group even though the position on takeovers as we have seen is effectively unchanged
can the council outline the views of the presidency with regard to the review of regulation ec no 12005 on the protection of animals during transport
we are discussing the issue of how to do our citizens a favour and make the vehicles we use as environmentally friendly as possible
ro madam president commissioner postal services are of major importance to the economic and social life of communities
this means that we must show real commitment on our part but can also expect something from these third countries as regards migration and asylum
like some of my socialist comrades and other colleagues i will play an active part in the monitoring group referred to by francis wurtz and we will carefully examine the conclusions of the italian committee of inquiry
when you want unity you do not start nor should you start with what divides you you start with what unites you

it is good to hear that the commission has taken these arguments on board and promised to get back to us on this issue
mr president commissioners ladies and gentlemen i would like to say before i say anything else that the integration of economic and employment policy guidelines is a step in the right direction
the commission is determined to play an active role in these negotiations and to further international development objectives
the reason for this is always the same translation of the trial dossiers into all the languages of the eu
by making inflation the absolute barometer of good economic health there is a risk that the current recovery will be stifled and that the prospect of a return to full employment will be put off to a time which is decidedly not reasonable
the scheduled date is the first of june 2005
it is no longer enough for a female politician to centre her media discourse on the real or supposed male chauvinism of her opponents as we can see from the sad example provided by the french socialist partys internal campaign for the presidential nomination
it is supposed to strive to achieve at least the aims enshrined in the lisbon strategy
this resolution also calls upon all concerned to comply fully with their obligations under international law in particular the 1949 geneva conventions and the 1907 hague regulations
however and on this point i should like to reassure mrs lucas since this is perhaps not the most important aspect let us come back to the case of the united kingdom which is actually still giving cause for concern since the twothousandth case occurred on 3 september
as others have done i would like to highlight two things
my criticisms are directed not so much at the council least of all the country that holds the presidency greece or the commission
commissioner there is such a thing as the lisbon process which speaks unambiguously in terms of the european union having social cohesion as its objective
they have raised their case in belfast dublin washington dc and now in the european parliament
furthermore i myself tabled amendment no 5 on behalf of the group of the greenseuropean free alliance and this amendment seems very important to me on the eve of the cancn summit in line with what i have just said my group invites the commission to withdraw the demand made in the context of the gats agreement that water distribution and purification services should be liberalised
i am firmly of the belief that the more the eu succeeds in enhancing protection capacity in the regions of origin and the more it assists third countries in bringing protection capacity up to standard the more the protected entry procedures from outside the eu will be enhanced the fewer spontaneous asylum claims will be presented directly to member states and the less lucrative the trade of trafficking in human beings will become
the indicators and forecasts for the period of time in question with fairly worrying economic growth indicators show that employment maintained a low rate of growth in 2002
the eu parliament too often closes its eyes to the persecution of such protestants within its bounds
at the end of all this wasted expenditure the french will still want to be french and the british will still want to be british and no one but the political euroelite will prize citizenship of europe above that of their own country
mr president this debate is nearing its end and i think that we are all agreed that the employment strategy has not borne fruit everywhere or at least not the same fruit
world public opinion will be watching president putin vigilantly in the expectation that they will be
the proposals also bring good news not just for juvenile fish but for other vulnerable species such as dolphins sea birds and sharks
the influence of events in building tension in that atmosphere is also very concerning as it shows that this is not an entirely spontaneous phenomenon or simply the result of clashes but that in many cases it is being orchestrated to hide the real social problems affecting people
we drive more miles to achieve the same economic results with more traffic jams and accidents to boot
the seminar to which the honourable member refers was organised jointly by the minister for economic affairs and the european commission on 10 and 11 may 2001
at this point i would like to express my surprise about all the changes in this report between the vote of the legal affairs committee and the plenary session
a few brief words on degression and modulation our farmers expect planning to be reliable and it is simply inappropriate to once again curtail and redeploy between 8 and 53 of direct income aid with a compulsory 5 modulation only four years after implementation of the last reform
in addition it is indicated that other countries too including most eu member states use systems for tapping international telecommunications traffic
then we are surprised at the results from ireland
we in turn have also tried to contribute to her activity
that concludes the oneminute speeches
remember that as part of the uruguay round and with the blair house accord of 1992 the european commission agreed to limit our oilseed growing areas to 5 million hectares
to my mind this is regrettable
this is the situation and in these circumstances the council and the governments of the centre and of the right have decided to downgrade the employment summit to a troika meeting
since opening the market will have different impacts on the markets in individual member states what we have achieved through the legislation is that the market will be opened step by step
it was said that we would cause 140 thousand job losses
fr madam president vicepresident of the commission ladies and gentlemen the oral question we are debating this evening reveals as many have said the existence of a real legal vacuum which leaves passengers with no guarantee should an airline go bankrupt
i regard this as an interesting proposal which merits reflection and indepth consideration
i therefore call for a european union which decisively takes the lead in the reform of the united nations not only with fine declarations and symbolic contributions but above all with concrete commitments and actual solidarity at the coalface
this is therefore a tragic situation and i believe that even if our ad hoc delegation is completely up to speed with the situation and is preparing to support both the alternative summit and civil society in tunisia we perhaps also ought to make the council sit up and take note of the situation in tunisia by specifically calling for the council urgently to gather together an association council enabling us to assess the agreement that links us to this country which without a shadow of a doubt is more and more disappointing each day
this keeps us safe
anyone listening to the heads of the balkan countries over the last fortnight following the assassination of the serbian prime minister will have realised that the western balkans have high hopes of the european union
it is an action programme
lastly mr virrankoski mrs jensen herself and mr puerta mentioned the extremely strict rule that is known as n2
it is necessary but not sufficient
the political situation following the first round of presidential elections in madagascar has exacerbated the breakdown in social cohesion and now looks set to plunge the entire country into total isolation just like the capital
emotions are running high in the baltic region concerning parliaments opinion and subsequent council rulings
but clearly the reform needs to go further in other areas as well one that i have particularly pressed on palestinian officials even this week is the judiciary
it is not only in the interest of the belarus people but also in the european unions interest to have democracy respect for human rights peace security and prosperity in this neighbouring country
the main challenge is how we can guarantee fair and genuine remuneration for every right holder and each individual cultural industry for the work done at the same time ensuring that consumers have choice and easy access to cultural products
we are extremely prudent
our contribution to the creation of a genuine community response to terrorism is this parliaments best possible tribute to the almost 200 europeans murdered in madrid on 11 march
i hope that this will bear fruit with regard to quality as well which is a particularly important point that will be addressed later on in connection with the oral question raised about the reliability of macroeconomic projections and shortterm statistical data
i also very much hope that the situation regarding ratification of the treaty will change soon and that attitudes will be significantly better by the end of the french presidency than they are at present
i happen to know that in nature reserves only on account of the faeces of birds for example the source of pollution is so diffuse that bathing water will never be of a good quality that it can never remain sufficient
it is an outright collection of negative contents mixed up together which would lead to an outright jungle where the fundamental rights of workers and citizens to highquality services would be simultaneously violated and it is therefore quite rightly opposed by the trade unions and by a wide range of social partners we call for its withdrawal
if the growing restrictions are lifted however labourintensive hillside vineyards will become unviable
moving on i would like above all to say to the house mr president that as the minister has just mentioned we are talking about an interim agreement the duration of which cannot exceed a maximum of 12 months this means that it can be renegotiated immediately once the treaty of lisbon has entered into force with the full involvement of the european parliament
political necessity is beyond dispute what is still lacking is the political courage to give shape to the new world order within the un in a decisive manner
mr president i do not know whether to comment on the hysterical remarks by some members of the house or simply to ignore them there have been calls for some western leaders to be brought before the international criminal court
as you yourself said services of general interest are the cornerstone of our european social model
the policy of the usa affects us all irrespective of whether these centres are located on european territory
the compromise proposal drafted in parliament is more of a step in the right direction
i could not agree more
prior to the election the government forces did everything they could to make things impossible for the political movements opposing them
europe must show leadership in solving the problem
both energy production and distribution are of strategic importance to estonia
taken as a whole the commissions proposal which provides for a budget of eur 15 billion to be made available to all the member states through the european fund for rural development to develop access to broadband internet in rural areas and to confront the new challenges identified in the mediumterm common agricultural policy reform assessment concluded in november 2008 has the full support of the committee on regional development which feels that the suggested measures if implemented quickly and in full will certainly be able to help pick up the national economies and make consumers trust in the system again while also effectively pursuing objectives of territorial and social convergence in regions of the union
just a few points quickly
last night the council held a trialogue meeting
before the vote on amendment 26
that is why we have tabled amendment no 48
recently at international level many politicians from eastern european countries have expressed their concerns about the situation in belarus and are prepared to work towards formulating a strategy towards belarus at european level
you and the commissioner responsible for budgets in particular are perfectly aware of the situation and we therefore hope that we can reach an agreement at the conciliation on the 21st
at the end of the first reading the council incorporated a large number of amendments adopted by members but also rejected several proposals
the publications i have seen were all kept relatively objective and were a necessary means of informing the public as to what this is all about
i would like to thank her for the very friendly environment she created both in the committee on the internal market and in the course of the talks and negotiations with the council enabling us to reach an agreement
it is also lacking in both the economic and political spheres since there is generally more political stability in countries in which there is a significant middle class
what i presented all those additional measures which were offered to the regions is something that came during the council and was not part of a global balanced proposal of the commission
to do this we must give the union the practical tools to achieve those goals
in addition with the ban on previous permissions or registrations you run the risk of undermining the system of licences for example in the context of temporary employment
the organisations that campaign for instance to practice sports in goodquality water have rallied themselves by gathering in excess of 10 000 signatures precisely to persuade us to integrate recreational sports
part i
we must remember that over the centuries and indeed even now many atrocities are carried out in the name of religion
parliament is perfectly right to call on the member states to address this problem
what our rapporteur alain lamassoure actually says in his own language is that the unions own competences must remain small in number
at the same time the united states china japan and even the united kingdom triggered global recovery by applying a budgetary policy that would have been prohibited in europe
it is therefore crucial for europe that markets are genuinely and universally opened up especially in those countries that are particularly dominant and competitive in the textile and clothing sector but which remain closed to european exports either as a result of high customs duties in addition to further duties and taxes or by means of nontariff barriers that make trade with those countries unviable
i would propose five avenues for the european union to explore in the runup to the johannesburg summit
so there is potential for using that land
i look forward to the publication of the document on security
we will gladly vote for the report
we must of course condemn these acts which traumatise whole families and create a climate of terror in the areas that are particularly affected
what we were saying yesterday about the stability pact is still true today
we also ask for the community support framework for rural development to be simplified through the creation on the basis of the two eaggf guarantee and eaggf guidance sections of a single agrirural fund for the whole of the cap
member states can play a significant role by producing regular satellite accounts so that the value of volunteering and notforprofit institutions can be measured
in short without sustainable development not only the environment will be damaged but issues that concern people including a lack of security disease and death will also enjoy an upturn
by producing standardised statistics on community migration we will be able to set up the toolkit for a social europe within the union which will confirm that the free movement of workers must not be synonymous with dumping or the lowest common social denominator but must be a factor in the economic dynamism that will enable us to iron out pockets of underemployment
the european council will have to decide the composition and the duration of the igc
this too touches on many specific budgets and programmes the energy programme the research programme mr nielsens programme or to take another example the rural development funds and the major structural funds for which my fellow commissioners mr fischler and mr barnier are respectively responsible
meps are experiencing an increasing burden of work as a result not only of the increasing legislative work but also of enlargement
i commend the recommendations from both parliament and council on these aspects
nevertheless it is a single wretched shuffling step on the journey that europe has to take
the guidelines we have set out on impaired assets and on support to the car sector are already being used to direct member states action most effectively
the quality and effectiveness of echos aid depend very much on its partners professional abilities
it is still more difficult and takes a still longer period of time to rebuild a country and that much longer again to get people to begin to trust each other once more
moreover the presentation of budget estimates should be more standardised motivations should provide clearer justifications and estimates should be more accurate
the european union ensures minimum standards
i think that is incredibly strange
these powers are no friends to european agriculture or indeed to europes rural areas what they are seeking to do instead is to use the agriculture budget as a quarry in the same way as they are trying to do with many other policy areas but what makes this so very deceitful is that it has the appearance of being a redistribution while not really being one with the possibility of taking the money out without cofunding so in other words the agriculture budget is as a whole more likely to lose something than have anything added to it
in my opinion it is of vital importance for us to continue in the same vein along the lines of the resolution on aircraft fitted with silencers which we adopted in march 2000
that proposal seems to me the most suitable arrangement and the one that will best protect the interests of the groups involved
we have tried to ensure that the professional status of inhouse lawyers is acknowledged whilst not impeding the commission in the thorough investigation of possible infringements
nevertheless i reiterate that we must guarantee the disabled full protection in the field of human rights eliminating obstacles preventing them from fully enjoying their rights making it easier for them to fulfil their ambitions and to achieve their potential giving persons with disabilities priority treatment on the political agendas of the various member states
it was he who started to do what had to be done to prepare the way for croatia to move closer to the european union
last year in johannesburg something of a breakthrough occurred and both energy initiatives launched by the commission are more than welcome
parliament and the national regulatory authorities have drawn our attention to that fact several times
mr president the lower clyde on the west coast of scotland has a fine record for building worldclass ships
the answer is yes but the form these take may vary considerably
the european parliament should not take part in preparing documents that meps are not allowed to see until the documents are adopted
these instruments firstly concern the flag state which bears primary responsibility for maritime safety and a political line has now been drawn
this is still the current cfsps strongest asset
that is the information i can give you mr papadimoulis
many members of the constitutional affairs committee thought that this was very difficult to solve
moreover these relief thresholds are optional
tighter controls on the airline carriers financial situation especially in the case of lowcost companies a tighter control on mergers and takeovers as well as setting up a sizeable guarantee fund are a few of the solutions which could in the long term offer passengers protection in the event of airline bankruptcy
latin american democracies are now more soundly based than they were two decades ago nonetheless their institutional weaknesses must be made good if we are to prevent social imbalance and poverty from afflicting an increasing number of sectors of those societies and destabilising and threatening the democratic institutions
it is totally obvious who is taking the lead in this game of budgetary pingpong but it is also clear that the budgetary procedures are still not precisely defined
industry is also looking for more energyefficient appliances to produce and place on the market
commissioner ashton made the point that in the united states we have a new and from my point of view very welcome administration in that of president obama but we are waiting for a review of trade policy which may take some time
for the union each enlargement represents not only a formal celebration but a necessity and an opportunity
this liberalisation of the market in postal services is still far from achieving a competitive market in which consumers and companies are the biggest winners
he favoured the lighttouch regulation that is a direct cause of the problems in banking
the real objective of the resolution was the desire to attack the italian government and only the italian government
we are now talking about an enlarged union but this is not the appropriate time to go into details
it would also be appropriate to authorise individual commissioners to exercise direct control over the transposition of community provisions into national law within the stated periods of time
i welcome the entry into force this month of the ccws protocol v on explosive remnants of war and hope many more states will sign it and ratify the five protocols
only in a european system of supervisory authorities can a balance be found between european financial centres that takes account of all the political and economic interests
i believe that this is an issue that the commission must take into account and that it has not mentioned today
consequently the report by the committee on legal affairs asks for this article to be removed and adopts two further recitals two further changes to the recitals aimed at highlighting the flexibility of the procedure
it is to him that europes citizens can turn in order to complain when the institutions do not do their jobs properly that gives him a very personal relationship with europe one that cannot be the same everywhere and that is what makes his position so special
in the eu beef farmers have to comply with stringent standards imposed by the commission
in order for us to have a vibrant democratic debate in europe we need independent media in all member states
mr president in our memories kampuchea will always remain the country of the killing fields
in such cases we need clear regulations in favour of the accident victim
i totally agree with the need for pressing on with the process of democratisation and opening up political life in cuba
unfortunately the european union is not always able to occupy its rightful place at meetings
i have two things to say in response to the comments and questions we have just heard
madam president i have asked for the floor in order to protest vehemently against the extremely serious allegation made against the italian police force this accusation is completely unfounded and unjustified
mr president this is very much a model case
franz josef strau the great bavarian european once said that we will only be able to remain bavarians basques germans or britons if we become europeans in time europe not being a centralising factor but a common roof against the rain of globalisation and standardisation
the commission refused to be influenced by the pressure
fi madam president commissioners i agree with those speakers who have thanked the commission for their good intentions
mr president since we discussed subsidiarity at first reading i will not elaborate on it now
first of all the presidency considers it essential to adhere to the timetable drawn up by the thessaloniki european council this will mean pressing ahead resolutely in an attempt to achieve a positive outcome in time for the european parliament elections scheduled for june 2004
we in the european parliament are asked today to deliver our opinion on a solution to the problem of reunifying the families of noneu citizens a solution that is both humane and realistic
it also asked the commission the council and the governments of the member states in a resolution of 1994 to do everything in the interests of the social economic and political integration of the roma
the fight against alcoholism among minors should be based on education towards healthy living information persuasion and the active participation of the producers and retailers of alcoholic products
the member states are not exactly inclined to legislate in fields like this when nothing serious has happened sometimes on the other hand they go overboard with the legislation when there are accidents
mrpresident first of all i would like to cordially congratulate the commission on its excellent proposal and also the rapporteur and other colleagues who have improved it in an exemplary and cooperative manner and achieved an early agreement with the council
second that the cor failed to properly apply the rules on the reimbursement of travel expenses and other financial rules
the commission cannot accept amendments 8 9 11 13 23 26 33 35 38 40 47 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 62 and 63
as rapporteur for the committee on economic and monetary affairs i must point out in this house that following a vote within the ecofin council the candidate put forward by that body whose appointment must be validated by the european council required a majority vote in order to be presented as the candidate supported by our parliament
my vote was motivated by these thoughts as well as by a great satisfaction at seeing this greater union safely achieved
section iii commission
we must demand that a committee of inquiry be set up to look into the events in guinea in order to ascertain the full extent of the repression and the level of the hierarchy at which decisions have been taken and by whom
the eu has played a central role in the creation and development of the world trade organisation and we are now engaged in the doha development round
for this reason i can only welcome mr voggenhubers report that is the initiative of the commission since it draws the attention of all of us to the key question that the effective respect of fundamental rights begins when respect for the charter of fundamental rights features among the commissions legislative proposals when regular and strict controls of human rights compliance have been developed and when the fundamental rights agency is able to work effectively
is the united states doing more than us
the honourable member also indicates other possible measures that multinational companies can take on the basis of these changed rules
in writing pl mr president the european union is a major consumer of energy and is dependent on external sources of power
however given the precise nature of what is at stake this cannot lead to the level of structural aid being dependent on the number of inhabitants covered quite the contrary
i would therefore like clarification on this point
over the long term it could paralyse budgets and threatens to break down wider social cohesion
finally all those of you in this house who believe in a better efficient market without obstacles and injustices cannot reject this proposal
that being said a number of agencies manifestly continue to be effective on the model of the european medicines agency
i voted against the report by mr roszkowski on complementarities and coordination of cohesion policy with rural development measures
teams of experts and other materials have already arrived in the united states
it is vitally important to analyse the causes of the accident and draw the relevant political conclusions
it is nearly three years since we adopted the eus alcohol strategy
de mr president i can go along entirely with what mr virrankoski has just said in that i see the budget regulation as a really important matter and would also like to reiterate my thanks to the finnish presidency of the council for having picked up a really live issue by at least proposing that we might take a look at what posts might be saved in the brussels institutions by reason of the changes this european union of ours has undergone
the berlin declaration marking the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome will allow europes leaders to renew their commitment to an enlarged global and competitive europe where solidarity is a central principle
this was a foul murder
the european union should mobilise funds develop programmes and organise specific institutional structures in order to assist the national authorities of the countries where the roma choose to settle in order to offer this community a decent material life a proper education a fair opportunity to compete with others free of any discrimination and a cohesive sense of their existence within european civilisation
the proposed total budget is to be eur235million within the framework of the financial perspective for 20072013
that is phraseology that would immediately lead to a discussion about deferral
in addition the council has accepted nearly all payment appropriations from the preliminary draft budget and only reduced the community initiative programmes by eur 375 million in view of the expected delay in the implementation thereof
he has taken all aspects of human health into consideration impartially
the strategy for improving the situation of european roma demands an action plan and therefore i hope there will be people willing to continue the work begun in this report which presumably will spread over several parliamentary terms
capacitybuilding the fight against corruption strengthening the fight against organised crime and bringing in human rights and the rule of law these words are familiar to us
we also need the agreement of the poorest african and asian countries which also opposed consensus in seattle
we have to use a security council mandate as a means of gaining for ourselves a substantial role in the reconstruction of iraq of an iraq in which all sunni shia and kurd can live in freedom and peace free from dictatorship whether at home or abroad
terrorist threats and public concern give rise to the temptation in the member states to drift towards a disproportionate preoccupation with security which sometimes oversteps the boundaries of freedom and justice
nevertheless despite the commendable concern for the sustainability of fisheries in côte divoire and for protecting local traditional fishing this protocol has apart from the tuna seiners been underused which is also indicative of the current state of the communitys distant fleets especially in portugal
children abducted by one of their parents
in almost every area we seem to find ourselves pursuing different sometimes contradictory policies
over the years the european union has taken relevant actions in this area and the measures adopted have ensured an increase in the level of consumer protection in areas such as package holiday services and passengers rights
i agree with mr swoboda that it is not just the bodies of the nation states of course that play an important role here but also often local organisations of course
i do not say that lightly because normally i am not keen on specific measures but my understanding is that the european commission is not keen on this idea and in the absence of such a focused and targeted instrument i think all we will ever do is talk
member of the commission of course there is no other way than to look at the global context
however the swedish presidency is working to achieve greater openness and transparency in this area as in most others
pl mr president three years ago we rightly supported democratic change in ukraine
member of the commission mr president the discussion at this very late hour has clearly indicated the importance we all attach to this issue so once again i thank parliament for the report
we have to work to make them compatible
many haemophiliacs and those with immune disorders depend on blood products from the us the reason being that in scotland and the uk we no longer use plasma from uk donors to make blood products because of cjd and rely instead on imports of plasma from the us
commissioner verheugen is right in saying that political factors play a tremendously important role in this regard and that the role of the political executive is also important here which is an issue in itself
i have an objection and an important observation to make relating to yesterdays minutes and in particular to the oneminute speeches
that means we have a legislative text that regulates european cooperation on the maintenance of law and order
another thing we feared was that with this attack the un would be fundamentally weakened
after all this regulation is intended to further improve all the existing provisions
financial arrangements must be acceptable in the compromise proposal we now have
naturally peace thrives best where democracy prevails
for example liberals believe that fair trade in particular is one of the best ways of fighting poverty
concerning smoking ban exceptions these are better than having no ban at all
sl i would first like to pay my sincere compliments to the presidentinoffice of the council for the success which the czech presidency has achieved under extremely demanding circumstances
this matter was raised 250 years ago by the famous french philosopher charles de montesqieu who said that when drawing up legislation at a higher territorial level it should always be remembered that small regions smaller territories and in this case the member states of the european union have their own traditions which must be respected
in addition to improving the quality and speed of statistical services i considered my main task to be the lessening of the financial and administrative burdens especially for small and mediumsized enterprises
i think that beyond the work that we have done that is the good news the main piece of good news of the day
our opinion must therefore be neither triumphalistic nor dogmatic and it must not fail to express our concern particularly on two points
personally i am also concerned by something else which i would like to mention the reports that we sometimes receive of foreign boats some of which are perhaps european that are taking advantage of this situation of lack of control in order to fish unlawfully in one of the richest fishing grounds in the area or even to use it as a dumping ground for hazardous substances which the federal government is also not in a position to control
the commitment you have made here to investigate this situation is therefore laudable but it does not reassure us
it is a main issue but the public perception is not always there
we as governments and council will be signing that treaty and are in favour of it
reconstructing the entire society implementing the rule of law improving democracy and human rights promoting equality and building a functioning government educational institutions and healthcare for the whole country are enormous tasks
these are the philip morris agreement and subsequently the japan tobacco agreement in december 2007 where the biggest tobacco corporations admitted that they had some shortcomings in dealing with fair trade in cigarettes and paid substantial amounts of money to the eu budget they are also cooperating very closely to fight cigarette smuggling which is not in their interests either
we need public accountability and clear guidelines that command public support
i have the impression though that many european politicians gave a sigh of relief that there was some continuity and that there was still someone in russia they could talk to
however what should have been added is that since january 2005 the only countries to sentence minors to death and execute them have been saudi arabia sudan yemen and pakistan
on behalf of the ppede group nl madam president mr president of the commission mr president of the council ladies and gentlemen today is an historic day
virtually everybody agrees the commission the group leaders in parliament that it is jolly good that two more countries are joining
all of this is quite clearly the fruit of an ideological and doctrinal choice of a kind of group thinking of economic theory which is the economic theory of the free market and free trade
the scandal has made the european authorities sit up and take notice
it is ironic that at a time when the european union and this parliament are striving to diminish smoking because of its serious health consequences in another area we are trying to allow people to freely damage their own health with drugs that have been proved to damage health and create other problems
i think that figure has probably decreased over time but not as dramatically as we would like
we could say much more but there would not be much point
we would therefore ask the commission to indicate more or less on an annual basis what the estimated margin of error and the estimated improvement will be
the vote will take place today
applause
the next item is question time with questions to the commission b61362004
ro i too would like to welcome as being particularly useful and i will be supporting them with my vote the proposals for transforming the european global adjustment fund into an effective instrument for combating the most painful impact of the economic crisis namely job losses
lorries are at their most environmentally friendly when they are off the road
nevertheless the legislative proposals the commission is preparing regarding the legislation of private companies and small and mediumsized companies should not affect the member states policies that have significantly contributed to the economic growth over the last years such as the single tax rate
whilst we know that in many cases this is unhealthy we do not know precisely why
let me add that although i understand the israeli people s concern for their security i cannot accept statements or acts by mr ariel sharon that i personally would condemn on the part of anyone else
it should also be pointed out that we are immersed in working on an integrated and coordinated focus for the different community policies in particular maritime policy a focus that parliament has fully supported as well as the even more necessary process of simplifying community legislation
mr president i would like to congratulate the commissioner on sundays election results in germany
we have to work during the day and at night and we are poorly paid
it is important that when we talk about the reduction of tariffs we sometimes fear that our agricultural sector will come under immense pressure from imported commodities
it transcends family or friendship relationships
incorporating the views of women into the fight against poverty and illness is essential to the leastfavoured societies since they are responsible for the care of children and because they are an indispensable factor in the wellbeing of individuals families local collectives and nations
the single most visible demonstration of the eus usefulness to my london constituents that i have experienced came last summer
thank you commissioner for that very important information now i would just like to ask you further whether you can give me answers on two specific points
there is a risk that the needs for 2003 will be higher for two lines
budgets need to be drafted within the context of frameworks
that concludes this item
politicians all politicians have finally understood that more needs to be done for over the past 14 years whether as a member of the government or the opposition whether at local regional or national level none of the political parties has managed to come up with firm determined and coherent answers
there have been periods of cooperation with iran for example in afghanistan that have been fruitful and i believe we should continue to seek such opportunities
news comes through on a regular basis and is always sad
the commission is right to propose such an optin in article 13
the harmonious development of the community as a whole and the strengthening of economic social and territorial cohesion require a strengthening of crossborder cooperation and the adoption of measures providing for the removal of obstacles that hinder crossborder cooperation
where no legislative instrument exists it uses that right of initiative to focus on a thorny subject draw member states attention to abuses and call for action
it is our job to convince world governments including the rulers of authoritarian states that this is absolutely not the case otherwise we will not halt rearmament
overall as commission wallstrm said we will soon have 16 states in favour
as in the past the council will make the final decision concerning the designation of the city
it is even envisaged in article 17 that the european union must play a pioneering role in defining un policy
we cannot be impartial faced with terrorism of this sort
this house and i myself have for many years been calling for a european year of action against violence
while making an appeal for the italian version of the documents to contain the italian translation of all the terms contained therein despite my love of the english language and of french for that matter i would like to say that i voted for mrs kauppi s report on this as on many other occasions mrs kauppi has demonstrated her competence and her abilities in analysing the financial and economic problems of europe particularly the problems of pensioners and elderly people who invest their money in banks and various funds for their future
north korea is a poor country where most of the population go hungry and do not enjoy the living conditions we would all wish them to have yet their government goes on spending millions of dollars on an arms race and on achieving a nuclear capability of which it has no need whatsoever for the development and wellbeing of its people
you also called on me to defend a vision of europe
mr president i wish to make three small points to add to what my fellow members have said
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on womens rights and gender equality nl mr protasiewicz commission i am not opposed to the reform of labour law if it leads to more certainty for adequate health care unemployment benefits pensions for everyone including those on the lowest incomes
as we all know in january 2009 the iraqi government took back control of that area
this is the very problem which we are facing today
these are difficult choices but they cannot be put off any longer
mr president i would like to thank all my fellow members
is it envisaging other innovatory measures with a view to developing this sector
i would like to ask the council can we do anything else and take further steps to improve road safety
many of us believe that that is right
in writing by insisting that noneu spouses of eu nationals must have lived in another eu member state before being entitled to residency in ireland the government is i believe in breach of the 2004 directive
as regards the situation in belarus we are all of the same mind and we all express our concern
that is both true and irrelevant for the character of the police office is not determined by which state body is meant to be controlling it
the severe problems being faced by the people of campania are nevertheless limited to only one of italys twenty regions and political and administrative responsibility can be readily attributed to certain administrators and we therefore call for their resignation
any extension of the constitutional negotiations beyond those dates would raise two serious problems of legitimacy and democratic transparency on the one hand it would mean a gradual dissipation of the constituent foundations built up by the convention and on the other it would mean asking the european voters to elect their parliament without knowing the constitutional shape of the future union
all of these measures are now producing tangible results
this makes it very clear that there is a legal foundation for what we are doing
on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs i have drafted an opinion on mr doorns report
no that is not the reason
de mr president ladies and gentlemen i too should like to congratulate the czech presidency
the fastest way to make them whole much more effectively and practically than all of the topdown measures is to support civic initiatives and the activities of cultural organisations and regional institutions
the listening exercise proved to be successful and should continue
european policy should be not so much to prohibit as to promote and to support
while we wait to discuss the fisheries sector erasmus and the citizens and if we cannot take tea since it is almost 5 pm we prefer during this afternoons budget debate to exchange the little budgetary titbits with which our rapporteur has embellished his magnificent report which is all the same very pleasing
i ask you this who else apart from the european union should take the lead role here
how to ensure that europes increasing role in the world is backed up with sufficient economic resources
fr mr president ladies and gentlemen as chairman of the committee on civil liberties justice and home affairs this morning i happened to be in cannes where an informal justice and home affairs jha council meeting was taking place while i was there i had the chance to discuss matters with mr marroni
how are we going to prevent the relocation of companies
all that the workers want is reinstatement and if that is not possible then redundancy payment
mrs sudre thank you for your support i entirely agree with your analysis and sincerely thank you for it

as members of the european parliament we have a responsibility to ensure that the citizens of the european union continue to enjoy the right to protest peacefully
does the commission believe that it could assist the fishing fleet in these regions by helping to preserve fish stocks in these areas
finally let me conclude by making two statements which the commission agrees to make in relation to the adoption of this report
from the point when peace was obtained freedom won and democracy established the world as it is has made it difficult for many of our citizens to see and understand the meaning of the history of the union
when the central and eastern european states acceded to the european union west germanys former suppliers the producers of dollar bananas thought they could now supply the rest of the eu
ultimately both the environment and vehicle operators stand to gain from this proposal if carbon monoxide can be measured and then cut back and if vehicle performance can be improved
we wish to assist ukrainians to build democracy and respect certain principles
i therefore think that if we try to implement a coherent strategy which fully involves the national parliaments by allowing them to debate national employment plans and make them their own we will contribute to democratising european procedures in particular with regard to the european employment strategy and legitimise our actions in the eyes of the european citizens
mr president as a european and catalan i fully support the need to reinforce historical memory in order to avoid future disasters while we learn from our past
the commission proposed a budget amounting to eur109billion the council proposed a figure of eur105billion and parliament proposed eur111billion
furthermore recent events have demonstrated the need for better rules on the management of companies and for appropriate financial supervision
the reality in europe is the loss of jobs and the eastward gold rush of large companies as a prelude to their final exit from europe
however the suffering was caused not only by the outbreak of footandmouth disease but also by the means of combating the disease imposed by eu regulations namely the slaughter of all animals on infected farms and in a buffer zone around them
the commission believes that next weeks european council will provide an outstanding opportunity to demonstrate both the continuity of european policy and its newfound dynamism
in europe our own children are being suffocated and poisoned and are developing allergies because of barbie dolls and toys
it could be said that this is a problem for the future but when talking about pensions we are talking about the future
as far as payment appropriations are concerned i will not hide the fact that the council is seriously concerned by the large number of payment appropriations that the european parliament intends to vote on at first reading since this intention goes well beyond the commissions initial proposal in its preliminary draft budget
in the european union there is currently a significant number of countries with positive results in this field
as responsible politicians we must be prepared to decisively contribute to finding a permanent way out of this spiral of violence in the short term
europes leaders agreed to put globalisation at the centre of its policy agenda and the commission has been busy equipping the european union with the tools it needs and using those tools on a whole range of concerns that european citizens share
nevertheless this measure was belated and ineffective for it was not the fruit of months of work but improvised at the last minute
i totally fail to understand why the door is being deliberately thrown wide open to abuse
the commission will certainly work with both types of problems in the outermost regions and the sparsely populated regions to get the best we can from the funds which will be available
we are meeting the wishes of the many citizens who have asked us in countless letters and emails to take action in this area
secondly what are the different scenarios you are evaluating
the second problem is that artists successful later on in life perhaps just a few out of the total number might regard resale rights as an enforced redistribution of resources in those later phases of their lives
europe has an identity that has been shaped by an exceptional accumulation of cultural heritage including film which has contributed both to shaping this identity and to safeguarding and developing cultural diversity
if we do not succeed with an eu of fifteen we are putting the eu of twentyfive at risk
we may well have come up with a document consisting of dozens of contradictory provisions in the hope that it will contain something for everyone
i am concerned that this agreement in its current unamended form will allow european boats including irish boats to fish in the waters of western sahara a territory illegally occupied by morocco
on 19august 2003 in baghdad terrorism reached a new low when 22 of your colleagues paid the ultimate price in the service of peace and international humanity
now i cannot understand why the commission is seen to be on the sidelines of the issue when it has taken the trouble to examine all the practices in the member states to gradually find a genuine calculation model that could be used in europe on the contrary i feel we are at the very heart of the matter
mr president with this speech i should like to resume the dialogue between the two arms of the budgetary authority namely the european parliament and the council
some operators are in fact in favour of making the rule on advertising more flexible to take account of changing technology by allowing split screens for example or the marketing of equipment that would enable viewers to avoid advertising messages
we can lay down rules ad infinitum but if they are not implemented in municipal practice they will have little effect in the end
you know that when proeuropeans criticise your commission they are not doing the work of euroscepticism but the very opposite today euroscepticism loses because the voice of democracy in europe has risen by an octave and has made itself heard in every national capital and beyond
a final request madam president madam presidentinoffice of the council commissioner ladies and gentlemen to mention civil society has become so commonplace that it is almost impossible to make a political speech without talking about it
however by almost exclusively falling into line with the approach of biotechnology companies and by giving priority to economic and technological aspects the report pays minimal attention to the major questions of ethics and safety which are giving the general public so much concern
the code you mentioned might or might not exist
so what
the aspects relating to changes in the development of agriculture are dealt with exhaustively in mrs rodrguez ramos report with which i identify which i voted for and which i fully support
europes times of strength have been when it existed free from domination by any country and when cooperation between free nations was not hampered by supranational bureaucracy and structures
but fortunately you will stay among us
although these changes tend to be painful in the short term they have a positive effect in the medium and long term
this important principle came directly from principle 10 of the rio declaration which places the citizens at the centre of environmental policy
i voted in favour and naturally welcome the meeting of minds that made it possible to
no british parliament has ever voted to pass british taxpayers public money to third parties who cannot be trusted
i thought it was an attempt to test my ability to speak in my native tongue
by doing this we are attempting to be as firm as possible with regard to compliance placing more emphasis on this element
i can assure you that the commission has no intention of proposing any changes on this complicated matter
i believe that these aspects are necessary if we are talking about an investment which should be sustainable
that also leads me to say a few words about the extent to which blood donation should be nonremunerated which is of course the major issue here
even after five years of eu membership there may still be instances where the majority language is protected in an open discriminatory manner to the detriment of the use of the indigenous national minorities languages
today the european parliament has once again lost the opportunity to tackle a serious debate on freedom of the media in europe which is being held hostage by those who are using this house for the purposes of attacking the italian prime minister
evaluations are thus synchronised with the planning and implementation of all stages of echos operations
the amendments are along the right lines and will mean the start of a more properly functioning market
the southern hemisphere and the us were calling on the wto for a monopoly on wheat and oilseed
this is one of the reasons why the french presidency wanted the situation of adults subject to legal protection measures to be improved
however we should realise that it takes the eu 20 years to spend that sum of money
consider transparency clarity which will improve with this treaty
our job in the fisheries committee as brian crowley has just said is now to focus our attention on the common fisheries policy reform package
they take terrible risks with their lives and the lives of their children in order to escape persecution or penury
on this point we decided to devote a special paragraph to roma children who are often excluded from health and social provision and from schooling
on top of that an additional reserve of some eur 16 million for two specific policy areas namely transport and environment has also been reserved
for example the world bank calculates that if we fail to act on the issue of climate protection there will be a 1 2 drop in gdp in the industrialised countries in the coming years as a result of climate change but a 10 fall in gdp in the developing countries this makes it clear that the environment and social and economic development cannot be played off against each other but are interlinked
i think that it is evident that time has also taught the commission to work along the right lines
its responsibility is greater than ever because we must squeeze every possible drop of return from every euro invested by european taxpayers
i also call on the commission to take note of the attitude of parliament and the council and to give the member states the necessary room for manoeuvre
europe should be sending a message beyond its borders that inhuman or degrading treatment of people with disabilities is utterly unacceptable
creation of a roma fingerprints database in italy debate
the motion for a resolution gets my vote since i feel that the jointly drafted text is very balanced and takes account of my two principal concerns namely the european unions structural deficiencies in energy policy and the quality of europes relations with russia
this refutes all those insinuations that the left within the european union is not prepared to join in discussions on the future of the eu or on the constitution
it should be recalled that the commissions original proposals completely ignored the unique and vital nature of the services in question and their relationship with the exercise of member states public powers
the posting of workers directive establishes the principle of equal pay for equal work in the same place yet i have to tell commissioner pidla that i do wonder how in view of the criminal energy expended on circumventing this principle in practice one local foreman or one registration on the day work begins is meant to be enough to ensure that the member states can keep tabs on what is going on
written statements rule 142
on this and all the issues identified in this report human rights are indivisible within europe as well as elsewhere in the world
i therefore believe we need to show a bit more solidarity there at eu level and that those who do not have the means to be protected are protected by those who have the military means
even though you yourself mr dimas asked for emissions to be cut by 30 compared with 1990 levels a poor compromise was reached to reduce them by 20 and there is no strategy in the transport sector on alternative energy sources or on technologies for green hydrogen
we tell you plainly that campania is no longer in the european legal space dominated as it is by a shameful connection between politics and the camorra which we have long denounced
the presidency is not to blame nonetheless it has seen fit to present us with 37 pages of conclusions containing 12 640 words
mr president ladies and gentlemen the group of the greens warmly congratulates the commission on its plans for reforming the stability and growth pact and is delighted that the council appears to have given it a warm welcome
then we have a scenario reminiscent of the film dinner for one at new year with the same procedure as every year when the commission cuts the funding for human rights and democracy budget lines and the parliament bumps it up again
in particular i drew the rapporteurs attention to better accessibility of urban facilities and transport for persons with reduced mobility and to the possibility of reconciling private family and professional life in a better way especially for women
i absolutely agree that iraq must observe the geneva conventions on prisoners of war but how hypocritical it is for rumsfeld to insist on this while denying such protection to those prisoners illegally detained in guantanamo bay
on the contrary i believe that if we respect these fundamental attributes we will emerge in a stronger state
more than 60 of refugees are under 18 years of age and that is why i want more attention to be paid to education and health care in addition to the basic conditions of human survival
applause
i spoke to the people in charge and i took notes for ten hours with people who had been systematically abused and mistreated in some cases for up to thirty hours
it is for that reason that we need more money but we still have time to analyse all these things and prepare a proposal
there is no doubt that the situation meets the exceptional conditions that commissioner hübner has deemed acceptable for mobilising the eu solidarity fund
through its legislation and institutions the european union has huge opportunities to conduct a good language policy that makes its responsibility in this all the greater
furthermore under the transition period proposed germany will have until 1 january 2011 to make the necessary increase
in fact i only partially agree with the report in question since i find there are certain critical points that do not allow me to express a fully positive opinion of it
let me say a few words on specific policies and initiatives in the area of volunteering in which the commission has been particularly active
as for the council it was just before the summer in july in our view therefore it is still too early to draw conclusions on the implementation of these codes of good conduct
what happens at the moment is that people comply with restrictions in their own country but as soon as they cross the border they grow a lead foot and cannot get the accelerator off the floor precisely because they need not worry about having to pay a fine
iran is almost at the bottom of the world press freedom index
we also want to change the term labelling
the belarussian intelligentsia is currently stifled in its own country
that is the point if we do not get this right we bring the whole of european law and the whole of our institutions into disrepute
i well remember how hard we fought in this very parliament for an inquiry committee on the prestige to be set up it certainly made an impression
from among the various strategic ramifications i would like to underline a single issue that of infrastructure
thank you commissioner for your answers
however as i have already said i think that at the earlier sitting of the european parliament when i received a similar question in view of the fact that i am rather well acquainted with the country in question i can respond but i would not wish to risk any accusation of exceeding the bounds of the competence in which i am here before you now
if not would it like any help from the parliament which has been open to the public for so many years already
in order to encourage car manufacturers to continually increase the number of environmentally friendly cars they produce consideration needs to be given in the case of public procurement to the costs incurred throughout the entire lifetime of the respective vehicles and their impact on the environment and public health
hungary is a member of this programme and interest in it has been enormous
at the core of the problem is simply the fact that the decision to close guantnamo is of course the primary responsibility of the united states the country which built the facility
in bali the international community clearly identified the destruction of forests as one of the main causes of climate change
both producers and consumers must take up their responsibility where the climate is concerned
the european union also has a duty but it must make a distinction between what is the competence of a member state and what is the competence of the european union
if the answer is that we have to address because of the urgency some of the issues that are inside the already agreed financial period then i am sure that area of science and research would be one of the candidates that needed to be addressed
the european parliaments rights of decision on the budget including the longterm financial perspectives are among its most fundamental rights
this agreement came out of the discussion in a highlevel group that i convened which included childrens organisations consumer organisations and bodies for content classification as well as regulatory bodies
i do not have time to refer to the sins of those greedy countries the member states from other parts of the union that try to exploit the fishing resources in areas far from home
i would therefore ask the president and we are ready to forward the file to him to speak to the moroccan government in order to try to save this journalists life
there might be a temptation to believe that any measure could be used in this fight
that is the only way to achieve a minimum quality and in the name of consumer protection to protect people who have little or no experience in booking trips from being lured by misleading offers
although it accepts this extension the groups agreement is however subject to strict conditions which include adopting clear priorities for drawing up the new timeframe for the task giving priority to substances deemed to cause problems for environmental health and drinking water and refusing to allow any degree of indulgence on this issue businesses that do not submit the dossier by the prescribed date shall obviously not have their dossiers evaluated unless it appears to be easy to fulfil the requirements of the directive
we are saying that now a goal has been unanimously agreed by the member states of 20 use through renewables for obvious reasons we have had to put the emphasis on renewables because we have to give some clear incentives to the market it is the market that will decide on the best technology and source of energy
on behalf of the inddem group pl mr president we are today discussing breaches of human rights in tanzania
i should like to mention something that has happened in my country which has made me sit up and think
very briefly mr president i would first like to thank all my fellow members and congratulate them on this triumph which belongs to all the groups in this house
i think i can say that the initial actions of frontex seem satisfactory although admittedly the agency does depend on member states when it comes to the technical equipment needed for the operations that it coordinates
such migration flows can have destabilising consequences and can threaten the overall internal security of a particular country region or border area
mr president on behalf of the people of northern ireland who have known the cruelties of terrorism for more than a generation i wish to convey my heartfelt sympathy to the parents and people of beslan
firstly i wish to thank all my colleagues in particular the shadow rapporteur mrs corbey for the cooperation we had during a long and difficult enough debate at times
in particular i welcome the double definition of juice from concentrate and fruit juice it helps to keep the consumer better informed
i also welcome the timely decision taken on monday by the eu foreign ministers to issue an ultimatum to hamas to implement the roadmap of face serious financial consequences
mr president ladies and gentlemen recently when i had to explain the function of our echelon committee i used the following example i said imagine you are a detective sergeant
the first treaty of rome launched european unification the second must and will bring about the transition to the new reunified europe a union which is politically and economically stronger destined to become an element of stability and prosperity on the world stage
the above demonstrates that i am in favour of action and this is why i do not identify all that well with the amendments that have been tabled in favour of setting up a committee of inquiry about the past
but europe if it is determined to lead can do it
pardon me if i exaggerate somewhat but i sometimes got the impression that you and some of your colleagues had a positively manichaean way of interpreting it
it is clear however that the current system of quotas is not having the desired result which is achieving a balance between production and consumption
mercury the only liquid metal is a beautiful material and one can admire it as a unique piece of nature

it is about using a large number of projects to highlight sports role in informal learning and its educational value and also the close partnership between school sport and the services provided by the many kinds of sporting organisations that exist in europe
this would be a very serious mistake because a reduction in the power of petitions means a reduction in the power of citizens of complaints and of the handling of infringements of community law
all these issues have been recognised by frontex the unions specialist agency
we could take the concerns of citizens on board and force a change in those amendments
accordingly its proposal to include the new dedicated test cycle for motorcycles in the 2006 stage as provided for in article 45 the commission will also consider when this test will become the sole test procedure for the eu type approval
that is precisely the reason why together with the action plan we have offered ukraine a policy in which the action plan only acts as a start with the policy being made up of various successive steps bringing us ever closer together
at the same time we must realise that more pressure is needed
i emphasize the fact that these confidential data can be kept in separate registers
i also think that we shall have some crucial issues settled firstly that blood is not a commodity subject to the usual rules governing free trade
the commission made an initial proposal in its preliminary draft budget but so far this has not received the support of the budgetary authority
the positions of the european institutions are currently quite far removed from one another on very important issues
indeed eu action on the environment must become so effective and visible that our citizens begin to equate the letters eu with environmental union
finally i would like to call the attention of all three institutions to the fact that society will only trust and respect european law if we ensure full publicity and social control
as the commissioner mentioned this sector is tremendously significant the jobs of 2 000 000 people and total revenues of eur 200 billion depend on it
applause
trials are lengthy
i believe that it is vitally important for the commission to make its budget support conditional on results achieved with regard not only to the field of good governance and transparency but also in terms of defending and upholding human rights in particular those of the poorest and the excluded including disabled people minorities women and children and to ensure that budget support is not provided for sectors other than those specified in the mdg contract
agreed
for all that we have to ensure that european legislation and regulations give added value they must be targeted they must conform to the principles of subsidiarity and they must be correctly implemented while at the same time being proportionate to the needs that they are intended to meet
i do not feel that this is a responsible way to behave
if your own group which drafted the amendment does not object and if there are no violent protests from other members i propose that we proceed as you suggest
mr president mr president of the commission mr presidentinoffice of the council ladies and gentlemen as the presidentinoffice pointed out the purpose of the spring councils is to examine and promote the european economy
how can we fight terrorism jointly
providing them and future generations with the potential to produce healthy foods should be one of our priority tasks
it is a pity that british members do not respect their own parliament in some of the comments they are making here
mr poettering has the floor
i consider this approach essential for achieving a further reduction in co2 emissions from passenger cars at reasonable cost
the judgment in belgium would seem to indicate that there is still no effective level playing field between large operators and newcomers on the market
i regret the fact however that other proposals were not accepted such as the need for a genuine action plan that is specific cohesive and clear with regard to instruments financial means and a timetable the need for a production chain mentality and the need for a sectoral approach in negotiations with the wto so that the sector does not simply become a bargaining chip
but we have to carefully analyse all aspects of the issue
whilst the european union should provide assistance to each country in particular periods but requires special help we must ensure that this is done within a structured framework so that no one is left behind and so that wealth is distributed fairly
mr president i too would like to congratulate mr lannoye on his comprehensive report whose contents are excellent
in the name of flexibility the completion of the internal market and globalisation employment contracts are being trampled underfoot and there is a danger of more multinational company relocations as in the case of gm opel in azambuja johnson controls in nelas and portalegre and lear in valongo to name but a few of the most serious cases currently threatening thousands of workers in portugal where unemployment is already very high following redundancies in the textile clothing and footwear industries
it should also draw up an action plan for lifting the visa requirements for citizens from the republic of macedonia
todays package adds up to a detailed road map to bring about the political vision agreed last year
admittedly we cannot spend without calculating such expenditure but in view of these continued promises it is commitment appropriations not payment appropriations that are being recorded
this is certainly not the intention of the commission nor of parliament
the passing of time has revealed new aspects of the sinking of the prestige and we now know for example about the astounding quantity of fuel leaking from the tanks which we have been told should have been emptied
who gave the united states the right which they exercise today to put on trial all those who are suspected of having committed war crimes when they themselves are often suspected of committing crimes in wartime
think about it
this is not some family squabble between britain and zimbabwe
it was tested to the edge of political crisis until the price of exerting our will became so high that only the unwalked ground of political crisis stretched ahead of us and none of us wanted to venture onto it
in paragraph 21 of the report we recognise that decoupling direct payments has largely been successful and we are firmly of the view that should be rolled out
instead the alternative motion for a resolution simply refers to the need to provide special attention to pupils who cannot be educated in their mother tongue thereby devaluing the basic principle of the vital need for education in the mother tongue not only for educational success in general but also for the learning of other foreign languages
fr mr president commissioner i should like simply to say to the previous speaker that this report clearly does not relate to the issue of enlargement of the euro zone but indeed to the state of public finances within the european union
the priorities for the energy recovery package however are really very irritating the fact that the commissions original idea purely and simply to support power lines carbon capture and storage ccs and offshore wind projects has not changed along the way
mr president mr presidentinoffice of the council mr president of the commission under the present circumstances reconfirming the lisbon objectives would appear to be of somewhat secondary importance because we are of course all concerned about the war its huge political consequences and the human tragedy
we all know that this is not enough money for everything the council considers important as parliament has its own legitimate preferences for the use of these funds
while acknowledging the major results that have been achieved it is also important to highlight those areas and fields of activity where community action has fallen short and been too slow in comparison with the parameters set by the lisbon strategy
it did not therefore gain the unanimous support requested so we postponed the final decision and debate to the next ecofin meeting which is due on 28 november
we have proven that we can find compromise solutions such as for example the gradual introduction of compulsory insurance so that the cost of the damage is never passed on to the taxpayer and the polluter can cover the damage under his insurance or the compromise whereby the member states must undertake to restore the damage if the polluter cannot or if the person responsible cannot be found
entrusted to european civil servants who kowtow to the powerful lobbies emerging in brussels european competition policy is the main vector for ultraliberal globalisation in our countries
the rules laid down in the code of conduct significantly restrict the margin for negotiation between the crs and airlines
i should like to ask the presidentinoffice of the council about the presidencys position on tackling the smuggling of ecstasy since it can be made in someones kitchen and does not need to be transported across borders whereas heroin opium and cocaine involve importation
we have agreed on two items and three more requests are on the table
it is the last one on our schedule today and it is not a coincidence that it has been taken out of turn
in writing pl madam president the internal market is a highly complex structure that has balanced the interests of the various groups dependent on it for many years in succession
it will be 85 both for regions under the convergence objective and for those outermost regions which are part of the regional competitiveness and employment objective
fourth from a european perspective the best of independent actors renowned nongovernmental organisations like oxfam or the save the children fund from the uk médecins sans frontières from france and so on have helped to deliver public support to the whole notion of development as well as providing a record for ensuring the swiftest most direct and efficient provision of aid which in itself commands that public support
it persecutes the kurdish minority and has still not apologised for the genocide of the armenian people
lastly i call on the commission to come up with adequate proposals at the earliest opportunity
this is the best way and we should promote it
this is my recommendation and i trust you will cooperate fully
the example of skyeurope demonstrates unambiguously that in our common europe we have not yet succeeded in drafting legislation which would protect consumers of air services from the negative consequences of the collapse of an airline
i very much welcome the channelling of the majority of funding towards european energy network interconnection projects
hardly any attention was then paid to the impact on taxation
i trust the commission will respond more positively to these points than it has in the past
of course it was not an economic recovery package in fact it involved correct supplementary political priorities with regard to energy and the provision of broadband in rural areas
it is irresponsible of the commissioner to declare herself once more to be taking down dictation from the council and not to have carried out an impact assessment before the proposal was adopted
articles 9 and 11 are crucial elements of this proposal
in future it should be the italian guarantee fund alone which would obviously try to obtain redress
my very real concern is that the 2007 budget will become an austerity budget as a consequence of many programmes not even being able to get started even though they are urgently needed
we regret that the report does not fully take on board our suggestion but we welcome the fact that it reaches a conclusion which is very close to ours
i understand that the figure that has been put on the amount of illicit trade coming into the european union by way of cigarettes is eur 95 billion and 97 of it goes undetected
if the union has a competence in the area of customs policy this competence is full and not limited
if both sides the governments in nicosia and ankara respectively really want progress then it can happen but quite apart from that turkey must discharge all those obligations to which it has committed itself and there have been quite a few utterances from mrerdogan that had been better left unsaid
we will not be required to work towards a new constitution but the way in which the european union is constituted must be adapted to new circumstances
it is therefore in relation to that work which has seen a real delay in maritime transport that i hope parliament will also be able to round off an important strand on maritime transport during this session or at any rate as soon as possible
with this in mind the commission is now proposing that sidefacing seats for which there are as yet no effective restraint systems should be permitted only in buses used in urban and interurban regular traffic there being in the commissions view no particular danger to the persons using such seats
central planning has never shown to produce positive results nor will it do so in the wine sector
it is important to have confidence in what are the european instruments and this enlarged europe with our coordinated action in fighting this recession will be in a position to respond to the most important concerns of our citizens including of course the one that is my first concern ie rising unemployment
commissioner almunia referred to the ageing of the population and we should also talk about the consequences of immigration the consequences of chinese imports once the quantitative restrictions have come to an end about world imbalances essentially in relation to the united states and finally the energy crisis
mr president in the last parliament much attention was paid to the members and assistants statutes and i think that was quite appropriate
we think in the end that this will be the solution because it was technically sound and also very fair
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 am
fr we support the author of the report in her demand that free compulsory and highquality education should be provided for all children up to the age of 15
it is fair to say that organised crime is still a problem even in some of our current member states such as southern italy
instead i have the impression that far from being a base document what will remain of the conventions work after it passes through the igc filter will be along the lines of amsterdam if not even nice
the reason i say this is that under this procedure we are investigating if turkey is contesting greek sovereign rights
for that i ask your understanding
obviously what has been lacking in the past is a common regulatory framework and more generally a comprehensive eu strategy on this topic
it would not have aided further developments if parliament had gone off in all possible directions at once
fr mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i would firstly like to pay tribute to the work of mrs grossetête and that of my fellow members who worked on this report
since they are in a state of serious disrepair i am asking the european commission and you my fellow members to support this initiative
in europe earthquakes might not always have catastrophic consequences however we still need to be protected from them
such a regulation which is aimed at increasing cosmetic products safety will guarantee consumer protection and health
i am concerned by these ambiguities at which quite frankly i am amazed to say the least even just hearing the terms used
i believe that our definition of the solidarity fund is too narrow if it is not possible for europe to intervene financially to deal with this despite losses of the kind seen in the region from which i come where one third of the provincial budget has in the truest sense of the word been washed away
it appears that this has helped us to understand better the dangers that we face
we do of course support those companies and enterprises that are able to invest money in it for investment in energy transport is economically of very considerable interest
with regard to the sphere of justice and home affairs we have two concerns on topics you will be discussing
we will be alongside them until the day when peace and justice also prevail in northern ireland and with them the european spirit among those who do not as yet accept it
we need to go further
mr president i voted for this report and i welcome it
at this moment in time the case is already before the constitutional court in kiev and at this moment in time i cannot see any really good reason to doubt its ability to pronounce a correct verdict about the right institutional balance for it has proven before that it can act independently
with this resolution parliament is sending out two separate messages
however mistakes have been committed and controversial decisions have been made in the name of this desired objective
i feel confident that with the active support of the austrian presidency and member states we stand a real chance of making significant progress during this presidency
it is time that the eu lived up to its ideals
the european principle must in fact become that of identifying the origin of the oil with the place where the olives are produced and no longer with the place where they are crushed as has debatably been the case until now
we saw a few days ago during the elections in kosovo that the serb minority was absent
we are speaking broadly about the safety of individuals patient safety
thank you mr queir
when we talk about europe it reminds me a bit of school where we always said i have passed or they have failed me
this summer spain france and greece have endured the same story suffering similarly devastating effects
as commissioner verheugen has already indicated we are determined not to weaken the directive but to put the emphasis on health policy
to do so is only fair for as you yourself both the president and the commissioner have said these governments are doing a great deal
question no 16 by h062401
to achieve this we need to break the symbiotic link between increasing growth and increasing energy consumption
this approach requires efficient coordination at the level of the european institutions
another issue is how european producers farmers can be competitive when in the european union we have different higher standards of animal welfare in relation to the environment which are not addressed at the wto
that has been the constant practice of all my predecessors and is consistent with the rules
it is a way of being economical with space and the environment
if you do that you will be on the right track
these constraints must be a permanent factor in the inclusion of less developed countries in the world trade system
it is also proof that europe by creating a more certain legal environment is also protecting its most vulnerable citizens
there are so many languages in europe that could become official languages when europe is closer to its people
in the act declaring the republic of latvia in 1918 it is written that all citizens regardless of their ethnic origin are called on to give their assistance for all human rights shall be guaranteed in latvia
reform of the pact must have as its primary objectives growth and employment an increase in which will contribute to stability or to be more precise will give the eurozone a real basis for stability and will be achieved by making a link which is de facto absent at the moment between reform of the pact the lisbon strategy coordination and the member states economic policy guidelines
in doing that the stability pact has a highly disciplinary effect it must not be abandoned but defended
i understand the fanatical opponents of nuclear power
the only thing is that to those who have focused so much on this entire area it must be stated that the sums involved are too low especially given the desire to encourage the integration of the new information and communication technologies into the various european education and training systems thereby improving their quality and accessibility
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen cinematographic works in their entirety those of the past of the present and of the future are and will remain one of the most vivid artistic expressions of our member states
within the european union of the 21st century there are some courts which do not have a computer or internet access a fact which is also highlighted in this report
the full support of the european parliament is required
the only thing i would say is that users have not only to know what there is in the intelligent car but also to know how it works and need to learn how to operate the modern technology to which so often we have a theoretical access but never actually use
this is why the committee of inquiry into cia flights could not finish its work there were european governments that were hiding their shameful acts the shameful acts of mr bushs foreign policy
this view has just been confirmed by the president of the commission himself
many of my constituents are already watching the thermometer with a real sense of dread
how are these facts to be denied
help is indicated here
it is engaged in a process of conciliation with pakistan
we also recall that when standing for election at the un human rights council iran affirmed that it was considering accession to the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women
for us this is a political need especially since we believed the promises of reform made by mr prodi and his commissioners and therefore we have great hopes for this reform
i indicated quite clearly during the discussions that i would not accept as a compromise the deletion of those articles
that would mean only months delay as regards the terms agreed between the commission and the kingdom of morocco
we particularly need to pay attention to historical and cultural aspects
indeed the european union must equip itself with exemplary legislation on the protection and assistance of victims of terrorism as part of this multiannual stockholm programme
the areas that present the greatest difficulties to individuals and groups of citizens continue to be social protection healthcare taxation and recognition of academic qualifications particularly for citizens who work in states other than their own member states such as in border regions
firstly pension systems must be able combat poverty in an efficient way
since the appearance of the report on the progress achieved by the end of 2004 i have been concerned about the fact that the average annual reduction over the coming years will have to be very much greater than before if the final target is to be achieved
i therefore hope to see the adoption of as large a proportion as possible of the amendments by the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy as well as of the amendments tabled jointly by the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left the group of the greenseuropean free alliance and the group of the party of european socialists
specifically there is no scientific evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of health warnings on labels in terms of preventing abusive consumption
this requires immediate financial support and i have a request to make of the commissioner in that regard given that income from emissions trading will arrive too late
it is incomprehensible that in the report s conclusions no request is even made to the united kingdom to disassociate itself from the echelon system and to germany to close the interception base located in its territory
and the council will remain active not just during the first round of elections but also at the possible second round later in november
the european parliament has successfully pressed for a number of improvements
on the one hand i was pleased that they showed me such trust and came forward but on the other i would be even more pleased if their direct superiors could listen to their opinions and resolve the problems
just last week a turkish airlines aircraft crashed near amsterdam in the netherlands and thanks to independent accident investigation the cause had been determined within a week putting an end to speculation
we have already adopted several resolutions on zimbabwe in this house
this report is taking the right steps in the right direction
luckily the commission did not go along with this totally unrealistic proposal
we should not be surprised that the trend for leaving the land and the high death rate among farmers are likely to increase further over the next few years
on behalf of the ppede group de madam president mr vicepresident what you said about having commissioned studies and preparing conferences is very heartening but let me ask you a simple question
i therefore call on you to support the relevant amendments
there is one explicit recommendation that i would ask the commission to take particular note of this parliament will not approve any directive by means of the lamfalussy procedure if the problem of callback is not resolved by 2008 ultimately the international representation of the eurozone
anyone who looks at the papers from the public consultation will see that the member states in contrast to the other bodies which expressed an opinion are attempting to shirk their responsibilities and the undertaking they have entered into by moving directly to the subsequent financial perspective
this is a direct consequence of the mistakes made in negotiating the financial framework
this is why mrs walliss report and efforts deserve full consideration
both programmes are approximately 20 years old and should we so wish we could say much about the past and future of these programmes
the debate is closed
not the security of talk that exploits peoples fears or that ignores the threats but the kind resulting from firm policies that guarantee effective borders and internal security
as long as the country is in a constitutional impasse it will be difficult to hold further discussions on closer cooperation let alone to make concrete progress
a recent study shows that the number of sudden alcoholrelated deaths has clearly increased since the tax on alcohol was reduced in 2004 and consumption began to rise sharply
according to the communication from the commission in 2008 the right conditions have to be put in place in terms of resources training and support for carers
this policy does not respect either millennium development goals or other goals but respects solely and exclusively chinese commercial interests
these include firstly introducing a management company passport secondly facilitating crossborder mergers of funds in order to reduce the number of funds provided in the european union and thus resolve the imbalance that can currently be seen between europe and in particular the united states thirdly providing the possibility of masterfeeder structures in other words the option of investing one fund in another master fund and having that master fund manage the investments fourthly developing a short only two pages long information document known as the key investor information containing the most important information for small investors fifthly simplifying the notification procedure in order to ensure that when a fund requests authorisation in a country where it is not yet authorised this does not de facto result in a new reauthorisation and finally strengthening supervisory cooperation
subject legislation on sects and its impact on respect for religious freedom in europe one of the member states france has a much criticised law on religion in which the term sect as applied to smaller churches and religious groups plays a key role
that would lead of course to an increase in social inequality
i hope that you will convey that message
but we have also managed to integrate the national parliaments into this decisionmaking process and we have also ensured that the citizens can activate popular initiative when the law so establishes
romania the country that i represent in the european parliament accounts for 25 of the work force in agriculture and 40 of its population lives in the rural areas
what i would like to say to our polish friend is that i think it extremely hypocritical to accuse the commission of providing only such information on the constitutional treaty as shows it in a favourable light
i believe that this fundamental agreement amongst the three european institutions is crucial to the credibility of the process the acceptance of the objectives of this strategy by all economic and social actors and not just the european and national institutions and is one of the conditions which i believe to be essential for achieving greater growth and employment in the european union
the current french embargo on british beef is a worrying illustration of this
i entirely agree with mr camisn asensio s report
it is therefore urgent to press ahead with the initiatives currently under way i have in mind the joint jordanoegyptian plan and the mitchell committee s conclusions calling for an immediate cessation of violence and the resumption of dialogue aimed at a peaceful solution to this conflict
the european union itself is the best example of this along with the internal market and enlargement in other words with the renewal of ties between europes geography and history and along with the economic and monetary union whose 10th anniversary we celebrate today
voting it down and quickly forgetting about it is the best option as far as i am concerned
the next item is the report a504692003 by klausheiner lehne on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive on takeover bids com2002 534 c504812002 20020240cod
this will be for the prosperity of europe
at the session of the general affairs and external relations council to be held next week the european union intends to extend the validity of the common position on burma
i see it as a particularly good thing that at the start of the joint resolutions we are emphasising the values which europe and latin america share as it is important that we see this partnership not only in an economic light but that we can also speak of our common values and their consequences in political terms
she is the fourth woman to be hanged by the regime in the past month
encouraging major public buyers to drive the markets and create a demand for clean and energyefficient vehicles the production of which may be more costly but is certainly environmentally positive is a way of intervening in the market which is legitimate appropriate and defensible
this is one of three pillars
i refer to amendment no 33 requiring the manager of the blood donation centre to have at least a medical degree preferably specialising in haematology or some related discipline
all possible measures should be taken to preserve the film industry in eu member states and accord it the value it merits given that it represents historical cultural and human heritage
security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents
mr president no crisis in europe and especially in the netherlands has had such an impact on public opinion as the outbreak of footandmouth disease
in connection with this i feel that it should not be our aim to bring about a repeat of the situation in the czech republic where a majority of people according to a public opinion survey now believe that equality and justice do not prevail in the union and that the socalled old member states continue to enjoy advantages that are denied to the new member states in the form of subsidies that are withheld from the latter
i shall not hide the fact however that i am very concerned in this regard
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen this draft directive is in fact the first legal instrument to be introduced by us in the realm of legal immigration
we denounced it at the time and can now clearly see how inadequate this agreement is
we were however obliged to support the commissions proposal in order to avoid any further watering down
first of all it is extremely difficult to make and provide a definition of deepsea fish
this is not a theoretical discussion
ukraine being one of our immediate neighbours with which we have close economic social and human ties is very particularly significant in terms of the longterm stability security and prosperity of our european continent
in a europe on trial we must provide evidence that europe works

but individuals can use that freedom only if they are informed about the consequences and effects of their actions
we call on the commission to implement the provisions of article 96 of the cotonou agreement applicable in the event of violation of human rights and democratic principles
author pt this year is the 20th anniversary of the mass execution of thousands of political prisoners in tehran jails
all of this serves as the clearest example of the difficulty faced by the european union when it comes to protecting fundamental rights
restricting income and expenditure impacts directly on all countries because it requires changes to the structure of financing cohesion policy and restricting its scope
mrs gräles contribution has done away with at least one of these problems this being the third one namely its minimal effectiveness
it has come to our attention primarily through globalisation and mobility of people and has become intricately linked to the policies and politics of immigration and asylum
the reason i have been following this debate is not only because the region i represent for example the village of md an important area for tokaj wine production is one of those that suffered severe damage and because in romania a neighbouring country to my homeland the damage has reached devastating proportions
the commission provides reassurance in a comprehensive declaration that it will reconsider the situation in 2010 referring expressly to the option of suggesting using uncommitted funds for measures in the area of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources
i would like to emphasise however that nazism and stalinism are the cornerstone of all other totalitarian ideologies
of course our initial evaluation is that not every means of involving them has been exhausted and that important efforts are needed
mr president yesterday i was in this house addressing the issue of the european aviation safety agency when i noted that the means by which it was being achieved was through the gradual integration of the national systems
mr president i was not present at the debate because i was attending the conference of presidents but someone came to tell me that a member of my group mr miranda was literally the subject of verbal aggression on the part of another member
as to security i would like to point out to the president as well that if we examine the question of security from the european citizens viewpoint then crime crime that crosses borders illegal immigration and terrorism are indeed interrelated questions
it was our duty and we did not need to wait for anyone
what was done in zagreb was a good thing
to avoid disappointment on the part of people who are full of excitement when they come to submit their applications only for the commission to turn them down mr takkula was brave enough to disappoint people at this stage so as to make it absolutely clear from the outset who qualifies for funding and who does not
but we need to recognise within the eu that not all companies are able to evolve in this way
it is dangerous and premature and surely of doubtful legality as mr cappato said to endorse a blanket eu regime of data retention as an addon to a telecommunications single market package
the first is that i consider the cap an important instrument that should be maintained even after 2013 because it supports enterprise
the proposal on which we voted today provides for a review of the current emissions limits of motor vehicles and the inclusion of vehicles that run on biofuels
its exports in this sector represent 20 of its total exports

finally the resolution establishes objectives such as fulfilling the commitments made in the millennium declaration in this field in which the european union must be a coherent and powerful influence in order to promote the role of the un as an agent of peace and a guarantee of solidarity international social cohesion justice and progress for humanity
secondly i underline the commissions strong commitment to the need to respect the target of a political agreement by june 2005 and the adoption of legislative proposals by the end of that year
finally i do not think that the general public will need to wait too long for banking regulation to be restored in the euro area
both the egyptianjordanian initiative and the mitchell report demand a freeze on all settlements
mr casacas report shows us how
the aim is to reduce the administrative burden and to release funds so that smes can concentrate better on complying with environmental legislation
the procedure is scheduled thus 1011 december council 15 december trialogue and then decisions will be made
in my view the most effective way to improve the situation could be through strengthening cooperation between the ombudsman and the committee on petitions especially in relation to petitions about infringements of community law by member states where the commission plays a vital role through the socalled article 226 procedure
the community fishing fleet is active in the territorial waters of around 20 countries under the scope of bilateral agreements
but i really must say that the council has taken precious little notice of us
it is because europe as everyone who has spoken so far has said has such a great interest in ukraines development as a stable democracy that i do not want to take a neutral view of president yushchenkos decision i think he is right in his political reasoning behind the calling of new elections
when we look at what has happened in europe and when we consider all the words emotions and print pages that have been published on the future plan for europe one key element is missed
i am sorry for having gone on so long but would like to sum up very briefly with the old saying give a man a fish and you feed him for a day teach a man to fish and you feed him for life

at the outset i should like to place on record the deep admiration and respect that this house has for the work of the convention and for the leadership provided especially but not exclusively by its president mr valéry giscard destaing who made an indispensable contribution to the successful and comprehensive outcome of the work of the european convention
jesus christ underwent the punishment that brings us true peace
having learnt the lessons from previous experiences and failures this was to be a surgical operation complete in a matter of days weapons of mass destruction located and eliminated a dictator toppled a democracy another democracy installed
i believe that the union by means of these instruments and various declarations has repeated its commitment and that of its member states to a humanitarian tradition which should take the form of the creation of a common asylum regime which provides appropriate protection to any person who needs it and which guarantees the principle of not turning people away
there is thus a need for greater investment in economic cooperation among our enterprises in research and in sustainable development
the rapporteurs proposed cure arouses disagreement on many points
do you know where the money we need is going to come from
a responsible body is needed which can operate at a political level and the bank is not that body
for example nonfat lollipops can happily be described as such even if they are also pure sugar
in all these the principle applies the more generally a right is formulated the higher up this hierarchy it should be set and the more specifically the further down it
so far our work has been carried out in a very positive atmosphere of cooperation and i can assure you that the council is prepared to continue this highquality dialogue with a view to securing an agreement on the 2009 budget that is balanced and satisfactory to all
the contributions from the member states of the european union represent 47 of the un budget and more than 40 of its spending on peacekeeping operations but with the addition of direct contributions from the union our contributions exceed 50 of the resources for the various un funds and programmes focused on development and humanitarian and food aid
it mr president ladies and gentlemen it is a serious matter that for reasons to do purely with italian politics we are unable to have a calm examination of the measures required
has the commission or the goepel report disrupted this market
while europe imposes customs duties averaging 9 for example many countries have duties as high as 30 or even higher as well as retaining major nontariff barriers
would a general rule that cautioned against the dual use of the solidarity fund with measures already funded by any other instrument not suffice
that is why we also think that the european citizenship concept must be tied closely to residence with the explicit aim of encouraging inclusion
i am therefore in favour of targeted social measures as mr turmes said
of course there are exceptions as exemplified by the support for the un international criminal court
there were also a number of proposals on highcalorie food and drink advertising when childrens programmes are being shown
es the coast of somalia is obviously one of the most dangerous coastlines in the world as the figures show in particular the fact that last year alone at least 25 vessels were victims of all sorts of acts of piracy
all of this is particularly true if the measures are combined with the need expressed by the council to maximise spending opportunities during the early years
instead of solving the problem of expensive and polluting energy the report wants to shape the eu as a hegemonic global actor
i think it will help in the ongoing discussion
five everything should be done to ensure that large companies do not use their multinational structure to evade controls
in this case codification is all the more important given that the issue is of a special crossborder nature
i am proud to be amongst the antiglobalists those who want to win back the internal market those who want to apply the rule of national and community preference and the rule of national and community protection in order to serve our people

that the commission should go so far as to do that really is unique in history
civil aviation authorities in other member states may have similar safetyrelated problems and corrective measures may be needed urgently

i would not ever like to see the imposition of a european union tax which has been thought about for the period from 2013 onwards
in the agricultural sector in particular category 1 i have paid close attention to the impact of the bse and footandmouth crises on the budget
it is because i am opposed to the european federal philosophy that underpins the report
the gap between the political classes and the real peoples of europe is getting wider by the day

whether or not we were right beforehand it is for us to take the most intelligent approach now

that is why i think the ombudsman is right to propose amending article 3 of the statute which dates from the 1990s
perhaps mr dombrovskis will say something different
how can we give someone possibly from the ranks of the commissioners central responsibility for roma policy
mr president for reasons of principle i would prefer the chairman of the committee on international trade mr barn crespo to speak first but parliamentary order dictates otherwise
mr president i wish to draw attention to an innovation in european marine conservation

you can count on my determination and on that of my fellow members from the committee on agriculture and rural development closely to monitor this matter over the next few months
mr president the situation in mauritania is actually getting worse and worse
i recognised and shared those worries and some colleagues and representatives of european business still share them today

whatever changes may come about in the political environment in kiev democracy free and fair elections the free expression of opinion and the freedom of the press remain the basis underpinning political and social life and that is one reason why we are confident that ukraine will find a way out of this political crisis that is consistent with our shared conceptions of democracy and of the rule of law one that will enable ukraine to continue to be able to count on the support of the european union

we come from the richest part of the world
finally when markus ferber and i started work on this dossier neither of us had any grey hairs
i would like to thank the commissioner for his response

prices may well increase for the users in many cases

we are talking about doing away with cabotage in 2014
this programme is the key element in the communitys policy to promote entrepreneurship and to support innovation in european smes
madam president as the chairman of the group and a number of honourable members have commented on my speech i should like to clarify that i was speaking solely for my own part and on behalf of the members of my party and secondly that i merely pointed out that whatever ones personal opinion of how mr milosevic and his advisers governed their country we cannot condone this sort of action especially when the upper and lower houses of parliament in his country refused to pass this sort of law and his country has not ratified the statute of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia
today following a real battle we have been able to reach an agreement between parliament and the council for regulating the claims made on food products and contrary to all expectations to have done so no later than at second reading
in europe we expect virtually everyone to reject such practices even if this involves people whom we think are a threat to our lives in peace and democracy
this appears highly improbable
unfortunately colleagues included sexual and reproductive rights in the list of priorities and i cannot and will not ever condone the killing of fellow human persons in this case babies before birth
yet european integration is exactly what the people are increasingly opposed to
i consider this to be one of our most important tasks for the very beginning of our next mandate
provision is made for all kinds of unnecessary exceptions
the next item is the joint debate on nine motions for resolutions on disasters
the present proposal contains no new special community provisions concerning imports by one member state from another or movements between member states of genetically modified organisms such imports or movements will in the future too be covered by existing community legislation
it is worth bearing in mind by the way that the roma population is very young with approximately 45 of individuals aged under 16 for this very reason it would be extremely useful and important for the commission to lay down specific concrete actions for roma children particularly with reference to combating early school leaving and the promotion of appropriate highquality schooling
the syrian orthodox church is treated even more harshly and as a result of the intimidation more than 100 000 syrian orthodox citizens have left southern turkey some of them to western europe
mr president as a member of the committee on constitutional affairs i greatly regret that todays discussion has been dominated by military jargon
doubts as to the efficacy of the mechanism provided for in the protocol to the trips agreement are reasonable
the text has not yet been voted on the compromise has not been adopted and yet these people are suffering great economic misery because of us
the vote on any motions for resolutions will take place during the next partsession
i urge mr borg and mrs fischer boel to protest too so that these debates are scheduled for a more reasonable hour not only for our convenience but also because it is much easier for the public and the sectors concerned to find out about them
fairness is also important at the level of the citizen
no
fourth from the perspective of the stability of the euro zone i am in favour of building into national legislation a ban on further indebtedness
in his report the rapporteur advocates the need for more effective participation from the union in coordinating its initiatives with the united nations not only on political matters and in decisionmaking but also from an operational point of view and in managing projects and specific activities
with regard to the other amendment tabled by the confederal group of the european united leftnordic green left i believe that my report already takes account of the criticisms contained in amendment no 11 regarding the extremely cumbersome nature of the risk assessment and control procedures for existing substances
i am interested to know exactly what we think is possible under the current wto rules and whether the commission agrees with the vicepresident of levistrauss who was arguing that ilo standards should be part of all bilateral and multilateral trade agreements
mr president of all the claims made by supporters of the european constitution perhaps the silliest is that eu citizenship does not prejudice national citizenship
would it not be marvellous if we could do the same with weapons
by spending more money time and resources on the area of renewable energy we can achieve them both and can ensure a sustainable supply of energy for the future
i had the opportunity of undertaking a threeweek study trip to the united states
this especially applies to the ebro delta and the sites there which are protected by the european habitat law
last week i was in contact with his office it confirmed that the letter had been sent and that i would receive a copy of the letter the same day
i would therefore ask the council to reject the commissions proposal too
by mrs icu on behalf of the committee on transport and tourism on the proposal for a regulation of the european parliament and of the council establishing common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator c601452007
i think we should take this fact into consideration
it is not just about people working on trawlers and people owning trawlers it is about coastal communities
fr there are two main reasons why i am opposed to the motion for a resolution drawn up on behalf of parliament s temporary committee on the echelon interception system
allegation of mass graves in indianadministrated kashmir vote
this undertaking is being discriminated against by the german vat authorities
if the proeuropeans had wanted to be more effective and straight with themselves they should have thought instead about improving and enhancing the european social fund
it is also vitally important that this should be made european union policy because this would enable us to maintain the quantity of fresh water in europe its quality meanwhile will be assured by the legislation
and of course in our daily existence we know there are hundreds of thousands of animals that we are happy to have killed either to eat them or to use their products in other ways
we know and a study published in the lancet has demonstrated this once more that heavy metals cause damage to the nervous system and also lasting irreparable brain damage particularly in children
anyway before suspending the sitting i would like to share with you and the commissioner the good news that a few hours ago the house of lords of such an important country as the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland ratified the treaty of lisbon
the question that will dominate the next couple of weeks is how the commission parliament and the council can be persuaded to adopt a consistent policy
i want to express the appreciation of the citizens of my country to all those in this chamber and in other european and transatlantic institutions who stood by the republic of macedonia in these difficult moments and supported our efforts to move from armed conflict to peaceful political conflict resolution
mr president over the last few days we in this house have seen exciting things happening
i regard the proposed rules on donations as clear and unambiguous
mr president i should like to begin by echoing what was said in this excellent debate and by thanking all of the speakers
the responsibility i spoke about a moment ago cannot be evaded we cannot deal with those people looking to us to respond to their despair by looking the other way
this is a political issue that now has its time
as mr el khadraoui said consumer behaviour has evolved with the development of the internet and the legislator must follow this evolution in order to protect our fellow european citizens
we should remember that one potential contribution to this year that must be included is euro 2004 which will be held in portugal
under the new regulation advertisements can only make claims that are based on the characteristics the products actually have
the commission is particularly focused on the need to lead the eulatin americancaribbean partnership in implementing new concrete biregional initiatives
it means actively supporting the work of the world health organisations intergovernmental working group on public health innovation and intellectual property
in the medium term and ahead of next year s election the government must also make the necessary constitutional changes to even out the differences between the position of the slavicmacedonian population and that of other minorities in the country and also take the action necessary to strengthen the representation of the minorities within the administration
our objectives are shared by parliament and as such the presidency should like once again to thank the rapporteur mrs wallis for her commitment to this matter and for her highquality report
very very little
i hope you are not going to state in your presentation that all of this will be incorporated into existing procedures
b502022001 by mr rod mr lannoye mrs lucas and mrs maes on behalf of the vertsale group on access to drugs for aids victims in south africa
el madam president commissioner there is a view that growing biofuels and trading in them may absorb the surplus production of developing countries via conversion to biofuels for their own use or for export
my advice to this house then is that we stay within the framework of the treaty while making use of the necessary flexibility that it provides both when times are hard and when things are going well in order to guarantee the continued stability of the european currency in the future
the derived cost and here i am referring to assessments made by mr verheugen would be the tendency for european enterprises to relocate in countries with a lax environmental protection framework
member of the commission el madam president i would also like to thank the members of the european parliament that took part in todays debate for their constructive opinions
in the great majority of cases we will be able to release these reserves relatively quickly by the second reading because you will have met the conditions we have imposed i am firmly convinced of this
the european union is approaching the london summit with a solid and consistent agenda based on four pillars a substantial and coordinated budgetary stimulus an ambitious regulatory agenda a strong message against all forms of protectionism and a sustained commitment to the millennium development goals particularly for the most underprivileged in the world
so i very much hope that the administration in strasbourg will ensure that we do not have to go through that again
the rules on arms exports must be stepped up
in europe our main instrument is the daphne iii programme which supports european nongovernmental organisations and local and regional public institutions and authorities in their fight against female genital mutilation
president of the commission mr president honourable members ladies and gentlemen when the lights went out across europe last week our interdependence as europeans was laid bare for all to see
we have no choice but to sacrifice the intermodality between these latter two alternatives if we do not achieve our priority to reduce the congestion of the roads
we have to identify those methods of communicating and interacting with the people that will bring europe ever closer to the europeans because unfortunately the community institutions have in the past been seen all too often as something abstract and distant a trend that must be reversed
its responsibility is to provide a concerted effective and sustained triple response to stimulate demand and the real economy with future investments to reestablish lending and to promote robust international financial regulation and supervision that provides transparency stability and appropriate incentives that eliminates systemic risks and that ensures that we do not go back to square one
it is for that reason that i support the text of the regulation
firstly because bulls do not fight each other it is not an animal fighting another animal it is a very noble fight by a man against a bull and sometimes it is the man who dies or is often wounded
we would therefore like to see a greater exchange of experience and cooperation between member states in this area
i would like to point out that the a to g scale which we all consider to be very successful and recognisable and to have made a huge contribution towards energy savings obviously has problems which mr reul i listed in my opening comments in other words this scale needs to be updated
deterioration of agricultural land in the eu
so far the commission has always assumed that member states were allowed to finance their services of general interest as a social mandate without this being regarded as illicit state support and rightly so in my opinion
but third and this is my real concern it is a new threat to the safety and to the health and even to the life of our citizens so as you very clearly emphasised it is an issue of consumer protection
we succeeded in overcoming this risk
a typical example is the agricultural economy not only does the community budget do nothing to reverse the decline in income of poor average farmers who are being driven from the land in droves but the system of prices and subsidies guarantees cheap raw materials and higher profits for the tobacco and other industries which process their products
in relation to environmental sustainability the guidelines maintain that economic growth must not be at the expense of the environment
if we look at schoolchildren their world of play is quite different from what we ever did
the firmness that we demand as has been mentioned must never however be at the expense of what makes us strong and what we strive for which is democracy the rule of law and human rights
at the european spring summit for surely that is what we can call it now the council congratulated us warmly and we heard the council express the wish for work to be continued on a services directive that opens up the markets whilst ensuring there is enough room for social protection
on the corrective part of the pact there was more debate and there will continue to be so in the future
however i want to welcome the review of the single market strategy on behalf of the members of our group
madam president rapporteurs thank you for your excellent work i would like to thank commissioner nielson too who is always sensitive to issues concerning developing countries
is the commission planning to publish a communication on the implementation of the esf in the member states and if so when can we expect such a communication
please allow me to make a couple of comments while the president of the iranian foreign affairs committee is present
we will therefore need better instruments in future
so these three points mr topolnek and then you will regain some prestige with us
these products come from third countries and a reduction in their supply might have serious effects on the european communitys economic activity
i think that by adopting mr sjstedts report and a number of the amendments tabled also on mr sjstedts initiative we shall see the cartagena protocol implemented fairly and consistently
agriculture is not directly comparable with other economic sectors
they must not be merged together as was done by mr goodwill a little while ago
but no politics anywhere can please all the people all the time
i think it is crucial that community competition legislation is adapted to take account of the specific characteristics of our regions in order to reduce these economic and structural disadvantages
i would like to discuss two subjects
i subscribe to this approach and this clear stance
most of the european parliaments amendments reinstate the amendments not accepted by the commission at the first reading and designed to strengthen the commissions proposal
the crucial point is that the sugar is added before fermentation and not afterwards which means that it is not a matter of sweetening sour wine and the addition of sugar is only permissible for table wines and vins de pays
mr president i would like to thank the presidentinoffice for this reply and i am very satisfied that the evote initiative is also to continue in one way or another during the italian presidential term
it is stated in the programme that what economic life demands is more internal market rather than more regulation and the programme prioritises the creation and development of a european internal market for armaments
this report must elicit similar responses
the promotion support and facilitation of volunteering and voluntary action accompanied by the growth in social capital will prove to be an invaluable tool in achieving those objectives
there is unanimity on the basic principle of the european union namely total respect for the life and dignity of every individual
there is a great danger here that in future we will have a society where people are afraid to communicate and use modern technology because they know that their communications will be intercepted listened to and be in the hands of people who have no right to them
it is no coincidence that this legislation in force has been the subject of no less than 15 judgments of the court of justice
therefore out of 433 programmes there are only two in hungary for which interim payments have been made
finally there is something technical to be considered because we wanted to wrap this up at first reading we had to ensure that the two documents from the council and from parliament were technically compatible
the european council was right to decide to welcome the people of bulgaria and romania as from 1january 2007 to our big european family the european family to which they have always belonged since they share our historic culture and common values
it is a very farreaching proposal as it bans the marketing and use of nine different applications where the substance could be released into the aquatic environment
we know that some member states see ratification as dependent on the passing of this draft eu regulation on the implementation of this protocol
we would all like to achieve the same result but at this stage we have not yet found the compromise that suits and brings all the potential together to resolve this issue
if we do not listen to the expectations of a younger older and increasingly numerous public and if we remain deaf to the requests of new users of coastal and continental waters we will truly fail in our work as the legislators and representatives of our fellow citizens
i must say that i fear the approach is overly timid first and foremost because there is information that this house needs to know namely that the eu possesses instruments for the promotion of democracy and human rights
in 2002 parliament amended the establishment plan compared with the commissions proposal resulting in more b posts instead of a posts naturally b posts cost less than a posts
the european commission will give careful consideration to the scope of its competence with regard to policy formulation on new and innovative services that will be operated in the spectrum bands originally used for analogue services
however their level of participation is not yet meet expectations and the latest investment figures are proof of this
it is sadly certain that the delay in making significant progress towards achieving a europe free from tobacco smoke will have brought about the deaths from a preventable cause of hundreds of thousands of eu citizens
the most positive aspects are the value attributed to the potential of the european territory and to its diversity and also the three key concepts for more balanced and harmonious development in each region reduction of the negative effects associated with differences in density connection between territories in order to overcome distance and cooperation in order to overcome divisions
it is a perfectly good system
this does not mean that we endorse a common energy policy in particular that the eu for instance can determine individual member states energy mix such as the proportion of fossil fuels versus renewables
isaak is also an eu citizen
we need to make room again for diplomacy and politics
perhaps the member is unaware of that
mrs buitenweg presents the matter in a very intelligent way
with regard to argentina it should be pointed out that taken together the european union countries constitute a majority in the international monetary fund it was within their power to generate quite a different response to the crisis in argentina
i would however like to concur with mr posselt who has warned against too much red tape
article 19 of the treaty on european union has often proved very unsatisfactory in this regard
however more and more european citizens are presenting petitions on personal social and environmental problems it is our duty give them increasingly relevant detailed and satisfying responses
what is your answer to that
the last budget level obtained during the first reading was a result of this process
i also believe it would be interesting to hear the councils views on the possibility of reopening the talks on the part of the better regulation agreement dealing with the implementation of the law which failed miserably before
we would never have been able to conclude the accession treaties if the acquis had not been fulfilled
the commission is convinced that the dakar agreement remains the appropriate framework for a democratic dialogue and for the achievement of a solution
only both combined can give the necessary result
on water management in europe
documents received see minutes
at european level and within the united nations the helsinki convention and more specifically its protocol on the protection and use of crossborder rivers and international lakes represent a framework of international law that contains this vision and these new principles
commission question time
apart from that though the new programmes require us to do a lot of restructuring and free up funds elsewhere
if they are suspected for example of having organised the attacks of 11 september they should have been told seven years ago of the charges they face had access to lawyers and appeared before the american courts
mr president mr presidentinoffice of the council ladies and gentlemen you will no doubt have noticed that french politicians are constantly talking about sovereignty and independence at the moment but the federalist activists can set their minds at rest they are not talking about france they are talking about iraq
all these proposals are put forward in the report for which i express my thanks to my fellow member mrs wortmannkool
at the same time there are a number of things in the pipeline
in particular i do not believe it is sufficient to evaluate active pesticides we must also evaluate metabolites if necessary in other words the decay products which can be more dangerous than the basic substances
would you not agree with me that the trade in art between private persons will experience a dramatic upsurge
i have already mentioned the stimulus packages
there is a clear link between child mortality rates and the level of parental education

draftsman of the opinion of the committee on legal affairs it madam president ladies and gentlemen justice that is slow scarcely accessible and unclear is hopeless
we should never unify those regions and their culture indeed we should support that diversity
it is also the first time that such a clear message has been sent to our citizens showing them that the community institutions will henceforth be concerning themselves with the social and educational potential of sport and its fundamental role in informal education
however over the last 25 years that has been largely identified with conflict situations and the real problem is malnutrition
we would however emphasise that the eus commitment to the area of space policy should be based upon the agreement between the ec and the european space agency esa from 2003 and be limited to the competence the eu now has in the area of space research
i do not believe that there can be and what we therefore have to do is make use of all the means the entire panoply of means available to the european union as a whole these range as i have said from diplomacy humanitarian aid crisis management trade sanctions etc to managing crises with military means
on the questions from mrs lulling and mr mann as to the assistance provided the communitys civil protection mechanism provided assistance from sweden and poland
comments please commissioner
we will be taking the matter up at the agriculture council of ministers in a few weeks and i promise that we will continue to give the issue high priority
we have to combine that with the issues we discuss here
i wish to draw attention to the role that alcohol plays in the incidence of suicide with studies showing that over 20 of persons committing suicide used alcohol prior to death
crystalclear support from the commission and the council on this issue is absolutely vital
the attack on beslan immerses us in absolute horror in the denial of humanity into the age of barbarism and we cannot help but feel sickened at the sight of parents put to death in front of their children or at the sight of children being used as human shields at windows
es mr president commissioner the commissioner has just explained the details of the commissions thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides clearly the proposals amount to a statement of the actions the commission intends to take in the near future
in writing i could not support todays motion for a resolution on the fight against terrorism for a number of reasons

we felt it very important that jurisdiction should be in the member state of the offeree company to avoid any ambiguity or confusion
on behalf of all the signatories i call for this situation to be remedied
it is in essence the war of aggression waged on iraq that lies behind the present calamitous situation which is getting worse from day to day

i take the view that the european union and the european parliament have every interest in continuing the support india as a constitutional state where hindus and muslims are treated equally in their endeavours to respect the democratic principles
presidentinoffice of the council sl the european union is closely following the situation in burma or myanmar
we therefore stress the need for a sea change away from these neoliberal policies
it shows for once that we have reached a state of maturity and responsibility
this they did not do which speaks volumes
mr president i must firstly thank mrs ayala sender for her report because our work was in fact very constructive she took into account most of the amendments tabled by the various members of the committee on transport and tourism to ensure that we arrived at a draft directive that could be adopted if not unanimously at least by a very large majority in the committee on transport
member states and market operators as well as the commission will have an important role to play in encouraging a timely emergence of financial assurance systems products and markets to that effect
i also think that awarenessraising measures about the dangers of smoking are crucial
as we have often noted before motor vehicle accidents unfortunately touch the lives of far too many of our citizens as mobility across europe grows
the european unions agricultural offer for example amounting to eur 27 billion is the largest ever made within the context of bilateral negotiations
this applies to the traditional providers of postal services namely the former monopolies whilst private postal service providers already have to add vat to their bills
no authority not even the president of russia has the right to present his nation in such a cartoonlike manner

it is not a coincidence that the year has been declared to coincide with the olympic games
the opinion of the committee on budgets does of course concentrate on the issues of relevance to the budget and there are with regard to these sufficient arguments available to justify the firm repudiation of the commissions proposal

thirdly have the usa sent people snatched from europe to these detention centres

vicepresident of the commission mr president first of all my warm thanks on behalf of the whole commission for all your important and constructive contributions to the debate on next years work programme which i have been listening to since 3 oclock

mr president the role of nsas nonstate actors in helping development has been acknowledged and i agree with commissioner nielson in what he said
as a fledgling mep my very first phone call to the commission was about a proposal in preparation of a european law on health and food claims
given how long this has been going on you mentioned the directive going back to 1983 how long will it be before your task force produces proposals for action

but i think we also have to make clear that our experience after four years is that parts of this house and i mean by that the selfappointed eurosceptics have always tried to reduce the discharge process to one option namely to collect as many votes as possible to take a shot at the commission in the hope that perhaps one day it will fall over
the priority tasks for the commission for the european media and for opinionformers in general including us in this parliament must be empowering the european political area the development of a european image and identity strengthening as the commissioner has said a core of common values the debate on the future of europe and the european approach in all types of information

they recognise that the quality of that food has improved over the years and in spite of the fact that from time to time we have scares and always will the consumers of the european union are relatively happy that we have given them a safe product
it is indeed a european problem as the commissioner rightly says
why not consider this idea
it is also important that only active farmers are included in payment entitlements
should we therefore see them as an instrument which is not effective admit that the policy of human rights dialogue with third countries has not in many cases led to appreciable results and give up on them
i regret to say that an active part is played in these demonstrations by italian members of this house i need only name mr vinci who perhaps do not realise that they are discrediting not so much the centreright government but the whole of their country
if no measures are taken the commission estimates that emissions of fluorinated gases will be 50 above the 1995 levels by 2010
it would allow exceptions to be made in cases where the plasma shortage really is an insurmountable problem
however we have little room for manoeuvre if as we have cause to fear given the latest line proposed all our priorities are adjusted in accordance with the european commissions shortcomings in implementing policy
mr prodis recent statements on the waste crisis in campania bear witness to the total collapse of the government which he leads
for the first time you are president of the commission of the enlarged community
secondly despite these improvements i do not regard the public finance situation in individual member states as satisfactory
even though what i am saying may be entirely superfluous i wish to say it since questions are constantly addressed to me on this issue and i believe i must respond to them
madam president ladies and gentlemen first of all i should like to tell mrbarroso that what was decided today on energy shows that where there is a will there is a way and so it is our will that you find a way in a greater number of cases particularly in the areas of environmental consumer and health policies
the three texts that appear on our agenda this morning are testimony to this the medina ortega report on the european authentic act the wallis report on ejustice and the lpezistriz white report on the legal protection of adults
moreover as it appears that the ballot box battle will require two rounds it is of great importance that europe should keep a careful watch on this ukrainian electoral contest during the socalled interim period of 31 october to 21 november 2004 and i would emphatically call on the european institutions to do just that
from the outset efforts were also made through the country s media to get over to the general public the eu s message of distancing themselves from the extremists
i want to underline to you that the council has always reiterated its commitment to combating terrorism effectively using all legal means available because terrorism itself is a threat to a system of values based on the rule of law
we do not however associate ourselves with this joint resolution of which we reject both the letter and the spirit
from the platform of this house i now appeal to both sides of the conflict in ukraine president yushchenko and yulia timoshenko both symbols of the orange revolution and to premier yanukovich representative of the ruling coalition to resolve this crisis through negotiation

we talked about the matter with our other colleagues since as you know other member states had major reservations about the tax issue

is this modest reduction in customs duties on cut flowers going to have a serious and lasting impact on costa rica and colombia
in the past motorised twowheel vehicles were somewhat ignored in emissions legislation
it mr president ladies and gentlemen i cannot speak for everyone but i hope that the nonattached members agree that the common area of justice represents an indisputable advantage for citizens of the union and will therefore support the initiative on the subject
one subject that has not been touched upon not even in the commission proposal is that we have noticed an increasing emphasis on rural policy in commissioner fischlers proposals
the eu distances itself from the increasing amount of violence in gaza and on the west bank israeli encroachment and tank fire in palestiniancontrolled areas firing on various roads the killing of certain selected people
if you cannot give them mr almunia please transmit this urgent message to your commissioner colleagues because it is about time we got some specific answers to these questions
we must try to exploit human innovation
i believe that the adoption of a time schedule regarding continuation has been a particularly significant step forward
this report rightly emphasises the important role which the national film archives have in preserving european films
we should also remember our own history of the past hundred years perhaps show a little more generosity towards israel and perhaps also begin to seriously consider the possibility of israel joining the european union that would respond to the israeli peoples deepseated anxieties while certainly not denying the frustrations and extremely harsh living conditions of the palestinians and would also respond to the fundamental issue of the profound anxiety of the palestinian people
when i hear what some members have to say or when i read certain passages in the report i am stunned and astounded
finally i would like to point out that the italian government is discussing the nth decreelaw on an issue which is in fact really to do with the roma and that is whether it is possible to include a reference to economic ends among the grounds that may be given to justify the removal of a citizen of another member state from the country in this case from italy
in particular there will be no benefit to taxpayers who must once again finance the universal service that was previously funded internally as it were being effectively subsidised by revenue from mass mailings and private postal services
then the gods became tired and men began to make laws and laws are now imperfect
fourthly how do we move forward
are we going to see something similar happen to the european unions agriculture and food industry
what is more 2007 will be the year of an important new stage in the historic process of enlargement of the european union as it is then that our bulgarian and romanian friends will join us moreover you yourself mr president have just told us that enlargement of the eu is the most important tool for peace of the last fifty years
however i would point out that as it states in its programme the italian presidency will endeavour to promote joint management of migration flows which preserves a proper balance between the policy of integrating foreigners legally residing in the european union not least promoting social cultural and religious dialogue and resolutely combating illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings
they cannot of course be eaten themselves
our relations with india go back to the sixties
in relation to possible specific case elements if the honourable member is in possession of material which could be relevant to such matters the commission would encourage him to transmit it to olaf which will assess it and take appropriate decisions on it in accordance with its mandate
our citizens should feel confident that thanks to technical equipment and the systems that we are introducing they will get help as soon as possible
against this background let me address three wishes to the european council
in writing sv the commissions proposal aims to harmonise tobacco taxation within the eu in order to stem the significant crossborder trade in tobacco which runs the risk of undermining the public health objectives of the member states
i should like to pay tribute to the czech presidency and in particular to prime minister topolnek who kept a tight grip on the framework of discussions by focusing them on concrete objectives
this is the reason i wanted to stress the importance of your vote over this package because over and above its actual contents it represents a political message sent out by the european institutions
in future there will be only one comprehensive national report from each country
we have been able to establish a regular and structured dialogue between the council and the commission which includes the european defence agency and the eu satellite centre
a stringent and constructive directive in this area will not only be of benefit to the environment but will also favour the best most modern and most environmentally aware mining companies that are also most serious in their approach
i would like to ask you to make a change to the nominal list
and then still in the year 2001 the commission published a working paper on the reform of the accounting system
it is also important to bear in mind the irreversible nature of any projects that might be undertaken
at the time this was supposed to fund the accession of six new states
this situation clearly shows that some member states are experiencing considerable difficulties in restoring the balance of public finances
so the reality is that good laws that are well drafted easy to implement easy to enforce and police are the key to restoring confidence in the internal market
at the moment due to the complexity and diversity of the administrative procedures for authorising variations made to medicines already on sale the actual operation of the internal market is distorted
we have a chance it is called more europe
if this issue remains unaddressed it is not just sudan that will suffer
nl a few years ago the existence of echelon was still emphatically denied
fi mr president one of the most common proverbs in my country describes alcohol as the drink of the wise
mr president in accordance with the gentlemen s agreement made at the conference of presidents i would like to ask for an extra quarter of an hour that is to say i would be grateful if we could start at 1245 pm
but you will agree with me that for as long as the parliament is condemned to being a travelling circus it is not sensible to force another eur 210 million down the throat of the european taxpayer
we have seen the development of a single market in europe which has offered new economic opportunities for our peoples and the enlargement of 2004 healed remaining divisions
i hope the council will work with us on them just as quickly so as to improve flag state controls port state control and liability
the oral amendment was adopted

by learning about each other s cultures the people of our countries can undoubtedly develop a sense of european identity
in this quest for profit the honest people in the business and there are a few of them who do invest in safety are penalised
that is not the sole criterion but it must be taken into consideration if we intend to hold an honest debate on this subject
but to bring security within our borders we must bring hope beyond them
i agree that the european union is itself a security policy measure that is one of the primary reasons for its existence
i personally like the approach of trying to increase the efficiency of the work of existing institutions that already operate efficiently and making it available to everybody using a relatively low amount of resources
this is a basic requirement and whatever is decided by any member state should therefore be decided from this point of view
distortions have also arisen in relation to the issue of guidelines on the slaughter of animals
in fact the more people see these images the more perhaps we will bring space down to earth
we ought to learn from it
the commission stated on the occasion of the first reading that it considered that better specification of the scope of the socalled permit defence would be useful to avoid any suggestion that this might be tantamount to a blank cheque to pollute

it would have been tempting to do so on this particular issue but he confined himself to the facts and to what is actually the case
the lack of qualifications the lack of manpower with special skills impacts on the field of small and mediumsized enterprises and the field of innovation and high technology
for these reasons and because the fight to uphold human dignity deserves our full support i voted in favour of this text proposing the adoption of a european parliament recommendation to the council on fighting trafficking in human beings

the post office should be a public service and we need to guarantee it has adequate funding by using the cash earned from services which are easy to manage to assist in areas which are more difficult
they may not be passed but the spirit of them is that this is a europe of justice for all citizens and all legal cultures
another aspect of the political approach that i have tried to adopt since the beginning of the legislature and which i hope my candidacy demonstrates is the will to avoid dividing the progressive meps according to their political culture that is often assumed for reasons to do with history and the specific identity of each nation each political culture being therefore equally worthy of respect
this killing was ruthlessly supervised and forensically covered up by men announcing that their activities were ira business by men who proceeded to intimidate the 70 witnesses to the crime and their families first forbidding them from calling an ambulance on the night in question as robert mccartney bled to death before their eyes and his colleague lay seriously injured
if he is privy to data or important information relevant to mrs haidars case he should make that information available to the house
as a pragmatic and experienced politician i take the view that this draft resolution illustrates in abundance that our european parliament and its groups experience the same difficulties as the commission and the council in getting to grips with the situation in iraq
if the situation in iraq had been discussed at the seville summit as mr verhofstadt proposed we might not be at sixes and sevens today
we can see obstruction for the same reason when we consider construction of the nabucco gas pipeline
they will help beekeepers to face the current difficulties and encourage them to continue their activity
although we can have common principles and objectives we must recognise that the situations differ between the european seas from the baltic to the mediterranean and the black sea

between 1980 and 2000 there were 250 000 typhoon victims
these programmes encourage access to basic health care and the supply of medicines at prices appropriate to the situation on the ground
reducing costs is not an end in itself because it may lead to a constant undermining of public budgets
next year we expect an upgrade in the institutional structure in order to achieve a greater degree of streamlining as well as a more determined implementation of the redeployment policy which i believe will have a positive impact over the next few years
the fear that people will associate social regression with structural adjustment criteria imposed by the imf or by the eu is shifting the debate

the communication recently issued by the commission on the position of physically disabled persons in the enlarged eu places great emphasis on deinstitutionalising the care for physically disabled persons
surely it is a matter of extreme urgency for both europe and america to measure noise in the same way in other words for the footprint to be determined in the same manner everywhere

improving the human rights situation in iran is a key element in the european commissions approach to strengthening political dialogue and cooperation with tehran in the future

but politics is always tied up with interests
the commission communication regarding the review of deepsea fish stocks confirms that the current levels of deepsea stocks exploration must be reduced and that the measures in force have been implemented insufficiently in order to be efficient

with regard to heading 4 we have faced the problems that traditionally arise in that chapter this year with the eur 200 million for iraq as the presidentinoffice of the council has pointed out
we need an institutional framework for relations between europe and america
however the european union still needs to be prepared for any sudden crises in the future
the second irritation which i am seeing more and more in my debates on the constitution is that cracks have emerged in the original confidence of the european public in the will and ability of this union to enforce fundamental rights and freedoms uncompromisingly
i think that we were right given that only yesterday and for the first time the commission announced a series of measures that this parliament had been requesting for years some of which are identical to those contained in the joint motion for a resolution
fr mr president ladies and gentlemen firstly many thanks to our two fellow members from the committee on budgets mr lewandowski and of course mrs haug who have overseen our work passionately and effectively
perhaps some kind of humanitarian programme could be provided for cases where some impediment exists such as political persecution
the newly elected president of the united states has already issued a regulation banning the use of torture during hearings involving terrorist suspects
it is interesting to note that not a single instance can be found of consideration being given to the fundamental issue namely that of whether article 308 can be used to implement a real change in the treaty
it is therefore very important that the international community react effectively and appropriately and hence it is good news as mr solana and the commissioner have said that the permanent members of the security council and japan have met to examine a whole list of sanctions in response to that provocation
the next item is the debate on the report a502292001 by mr evans on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs on the implementation of rules on competition
are they hostile are they friendly
combating illegal immigration should be part of a much broader agenda an agenda to harness the benefits of immigration rather than vainly trying to stop it
what are you proposing that will enable the european union to speak with one voice when dealing with the producer countries and people are always talking about speaking with one voice so that all these neighbourhood policies and partnership agreements can at last take proper account of the energy dimension
this means that a constitutional legal system will be based on the charter of fundamental rights of the union
mrs de keyser expressed exactly what i feel when she questioned where we stand
i would like to thank them all
thirdly i hope you will give up that metaphysical position which allows you to state that you support mr baker s efforts without specifying exactly how you propose to do so

we understand that the withdrawal of public aid for fleet modernisation and renewal will not be acceptable to everyone but we believe that it is only logical in the circumstances
we know that china often puts pressure on hong kong to get it to accept legislation there that exists in china
in parallel to this however the commission is continuing its crusade to privatise the railways without even reviewing ten disastrous years
despite the very open way in which i have proceeded with the work it is inevitable that some of the interpretations of its outcome will be politicised or maybe even misunderstood
if conditions laid down as binding in the accession treaties are not met then the application of these rules does not amount to discrimination against a country but is nothing other than the fulfilment of an agreement between the contracting parties
mr president mr vicepresident ladies and gentlemen the group of the european peoples party christian democrats and european democrats thanks the rapporteur for producing his report promptly quickly clearly and precisely and we are able to support it
there is an ever greater connection between human rights in the unions external policy and in its internal policy and one example of this is the growing link between security development cooperation and human rights

this work could be improved by the establishment of a community centre for the protection and welfare of animals
we can decide ourselves to sign a bilateral agreement with the us as portugal has done
the marco polo ii programme has then in essence had an advance green light from all three institutions and that has prompted us to make the attempt to complete this legislative project as early as first reading and have it ready for use and it is thanks to a great deal of willingness on the part of the commission in particular but also of the council of transport ministers that we have succeeded in this
on 14 september the ukrainian parliament held a debate on euukraine relations
this makes no sense at all
for example the presence of us armed forces in the country is unlikely to help to restore peace since it is evident that those who wanted the war and carried it out are attracting terrorism through their presence there rather than bringing calm
responsibility during temporary storage should remain with the owner of the storage installation while the member states should assume administrative and financial responsibility for safe final disposal
at this extraordinary sitting we are to debate an issue of global importance since climate change and the energy issues associated with it are common challenges for the european union as well as for all the peoples of the world
i would just like to say as an initial point to those who cast doubt on climate change that in any case the need to eventually wean ourselves off oil in itself makes this whole directive essential
if the commission were to designate 2011 the european year of volunteers this would allow the eu institutions in collaboration with voluntary organisations to work towards common objectives as i said earlier to add value at european level
author mr president the arctic has been described as the last imaginary place

in our view it entails eventually harmonising the management documents on the one hand and on the other hand getting to a point where total cabotage expenditure of 2 is properly monitored at european level for certain countries however this does mean 3040 of the work in this sector
it is also a question of principle because i think we should decide for ourselves what we want for our citizens and we should not let fear for the sharia get the better of us
i think it is timely to remind those especially in my own country who are rightly exercised about global warming climate change and greenhouse gas emission increases and who have concerns on the other hand about ratifying the lisbon treaty or the reform treaty as we underline that the environment and climate change are specifically included in the lisbon treaty as distinct from the past constitutional treaty a most important point to underline
i am convinced that weather services and map information do not even fall within the scope of this directive and even if they did they would be protected in a carefully considered list of exceptions
i am delighted to indicate my support for this report and for the extension of the peace programme
this is no mere bagatelle
we are also asking for clear management structures and this is very important for safe havens
it was therefore good yesterday to hear gordon browns clear message when he declared we will not walk away
this is a dangerous way to think and i do not believe that we should use such arguments
finally the qualifications of blood establishment staff
it was appalling a community that exported gangsterism

they look pretty nice indeed
other devices will be applied to the port state
first at 19 of gdp our investment in research and development is well below levels in the usa and japan and with only two of the accession countries spending more than 1 of gdp on research and development we will be hard pressed to reach the 3 lisbon target by 2010
i myself and all those who know me know that this is perhaps a kind of hobby of mine outside politics have always advocated human rights education
in order for this to be achieved complex programmes are needed that help those who fall outside our field of vision as well as those who will not make it to the job market and that are able to rehabilitate human resources and its environment at the same time
it is important not to lose track of the prospect that iwt will be just as clean as road transport this is also something the sector itself is in favour of
they could become adequate however if we achieved economic growth and if that growth were directed at creating the jobs needed on our continent the figures are far below those of our main competitors the united states and japan

while we acknowledge the high quality of its work we feel that the way in which the praesidium and you yourself mr giscard destaing conducted the conventions work the rules chosen to govern the process must be carefully assessed and analysed for they have had a definite effect on the quality of the text adopted
at the last sitting of the convention that you attended mr presidentinoffice of the council and members of the convention i suggested that the intergovernmental conference should take its inspiration from our working method which was actually imposed on us by making it mandatory to make public if necessary on the internet any proposal to change the constitution and any amendment to it
that is why a parliamentary temporary committee could be useful after the twofold disaster of the erika and the prestige my region was a victim of both provided of course that we ensure that it does not become a forum for settling petty political scores as could have been inferred from the circumstances in which certain members proposed a committee of inquiry
let me take this opportunity to put the very straightforward question and i am glad that the vicepresident is here as to whether it makes sense to use the reach project to enhance the competitiveness of industries outside the european union while ushering in a programme of deindustrialisation at home
we must do more in this respect because this concerns not only iran but other countries too
i call upon the council and the commission who are more aware of the need to respect the principles enshrined in the treaties to correct this dangerous drift
i agree with all of those who say it is time that all the fine words are translated into real action
we badly need an international treaty on the management of the arctic region but its starting point and main goal must be conservation of the region a similar moratorium as that for the antarctic
the prevention of environmental damage and damage caused by human activity entails the strengthening and development of civil protection resources and capabilities at local national and european level

let me start with the final point in our report

in the predigital world purchases of books and records could be regarded as a reflection of normal consumer trends
de mr president mr vicepresident in your introduction you pointed out that the commission does not want to launch out blindly but sound out whether something should be done by discussing it with the member states
it is of course crucial to everybody round the world to be sure that they can feed their own people but it is not exclusively a chapter in our negotiations
it is unusually susceptible to the damaging effects of petroleum products
i believe that a procedure such as mr sjstedt describes is out of the question
this morning it was lamented as it will be this evening too that we do not spend enough money in this field in an area that really does have an impact on people on europes citizens and builds a link between them and europe
we are trying to assess how things have worked in practice and we believe we can say without hesitation that the position of the ecofin council has been respected
maybe he is dealing with his personal future but i would say for the 2009 commission that it would be worthwhile considering having a special commissioner for the financial markets who will concentrate only on this because i think this is a really major subject for europe and for the european commission
when we talk about how we should reform agricultural policy in europe as the commission recently proposed in order thereby to bring agricultural policy closer to the public and in this case closer to the taxpayers something to which mrs schierhuber a farmer herself referred and on which point i wish to give her my support we have to distance ourselves from such quibbles about what is control and what is directed against fraud

i would like to thank the commissioner for her statements on milk
commission question time
for this reason carrying on as before is not a political option and will not resolve the deadlock

we cannot accept that the mere fact of complying with legal activities should be a licence to fail to comply or to be able to act irresponsibly
i have already said in my introduction that in my opinion the eu has adopted an entirely correct approach by not opting for one or the other but saying only that we have rescued the banking sector and now all that remains is to clean it up

thatcher chirac berlusconi they were all epp leaders too but you seem to have overlooked their contributions
the enlargement of the eurozone to include one of the new member states is an extremely important and positive step in the european unions economic and monetary integration
it is a political scandal it is an economic scandal and it is a scandalous mass violation of human rights and the rules of democracy which is why any strategic plan dealing with echelontype espionage systems should force governments and international organisations to face squarely up to their responsibilities

until the day when like the man hoist with his own petard the socialist leaders find themselves at the receiving end of the stone throwing

thirdly the european union must acquire full membership in the security council and in the general assembly

the problem comes when a report of this nature fails to make even so much as a murmur about the problem of illegal immigration despite the fact that it is a very important problem when we are discussing problems relating to cooperation with africa on development

let us get our act together let us do something not just for transparency but for good spending

todays debts are tomorrows taxes and the commission ought to ensure that national measures are linked to the lisbon strategy and do not jeopardise the sustainability of finances
this official support i trust you are indeed supporting the reform mr galeote would be most welcome from all the honourable members

for a start the councils authority to draw up guidelines should be done away with as secondly should article 9s restriction on control by the court of justice
finally the call for a more simple procedure for logging complaints would simplify and demystify the complaints procedure for european citizens
witold pilecki an officer in the polish army who took part in the september campaign during the german occupation of poland organised a resistance movement in auschwitz having become a voluntary prisoner there
hu it is perhaps no coincidence that the preparation of the 2010 budget is attracting this much attention

it would be worth considering the introduction of a special support system for the beekeeping sector in view of its highly beneficial impact on the natural environment
it is absolutely crucial that the proclaimed reform of the cap can incorporate these and other principles
decoupling has to a large extent been successful
we also call on human rights commissions to penalise including in court violations of this kind taking place in both countries
i also would like to say to mr karas that what you mentioned is absolutely right we have a possibility as the commission to examine the methodology that is used by the member states
as to the issue of classification the commission wishes to maintain the sufficient category with the aim of reaching an agreement that would allow the european union to adopt a better framework for bathing waters than the present one
during our presidency we have pondered various options for establishing an interinstitutional agreement on the regulatory agencies
we now have another example like that before us in the shape of the bathing water directive
mr president commissioner the european convention proposes that the conservation of the seas biological resources must be the exclusive competence of the eu while fishing should be an area in which the eu and the member states have shared competence
that is a very important factor for ensuring the continued protection of sources of water
the remainder are mostly provisions for which the commission itself is responsible and which will be drafted and amended over coming months taking account of your recommendations
therefore like mr costa i would like to ask the commission to extend the provisions on survey and approval to include these types of ship as soon as possible
i want to draw the attention of parliament and especially members of the committee on development and cooperation to the communication on the reform of stateowned enterprises that we have pursued in the commission
in italy for example the introduction of quotas for economic migration has not reduced the level of illegal immigration into that country
i would also like to express the councils satisfaction at the agreement we reached with regard to the common foreign and security policy
this is in my opinion the cornerstone of a partnership with developing countries
mr president the commission warmly welcomes mr lauks report and is grateful for the highquality work of parliaments committee on economic and monetary affairs
on the other hand a social model based on rigid and short working time and on avoiding competition not just at a global level but at the level of the common market is the road to social and economic crisis
what about the basic discussion we should be having though with our american partners about the situation the risk of their economy going into a recession the problem with organising decoupling at the start of this recession and of course the exchange rate issue
in this respect it is absolutely justified to renew the commitment to cooperate in the strengthening of the democratic institutions
it may form part of the solution but it has to be in addition to the commitments made by individual states and by the international institutions and not instead of them
let me mention just a few of them the killing of girls who are unwanted in the context of sex selection trafficking in human beings and sexual slavery stealing of children denial of the legal existence of children from second and further pregnancies abandoned children violence against pregnant women forced abortions postabortion problems and womens suicides
member of the commission without any doubt this is an area which needs attention not least as concerns risk
it is high time far greater attention was paid to local and regional water management
the first point i would like to make is that the proposal to limit the budget to 1 is not inspired by the wish to economise nor does it stem from a desire to rationalise expenditure
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday 14 june 2001
parliament must therefore be taken seriously when it talks about this issue
north korea has always tried to negotiate using threats and intimidation
as someone once said stuff happens
i am glad that there are already three further countries spain portugal and finland which have said that they will be removing the barriers

then we will be left totally behind being dependent on imports of ethanol and biodiesel because if we do not have these in place we will not be able to meet the targets of 20 greenhouse gas emission by 2020

my baptism and i hope it will not be a baptism of fire will take place tomorrow evening
we also share a common desire for a new financial regulation hence our pressure on the finnish presidency to ensure that we can work on the basis of the new financial regulation in 2007
at this point the least demagogical most practical approach that will allow europe to take swift action to support the emergency efforts and reconstruction in the abruzzo is to review the regions 20072013 operative programme that is to say the structural funds the abruzzo operative programme currently provides for eur 140 million in european cofinancing for a total programme cost of eur 345 million with the difference made up by national cofinancing
every spring summit seems to me like a nonstop rerun of the delors white paper
mr president i regret the fact that some groups in this parliament obviously prefer that party financing should remain in the twilight zone where it is at present
mr president the most important aspect of this budget is how it aids and supports the economy of europe in its entirety as well as developing and strengthening the economy something which is really needed at present
the vote will take place during the december partsession
in denmark we have a health policy based on a balanced diet involving healthy and natural foods
these two forms of radicalism are what we need to eradicate in order to have peace and not terrorism
the passage on the socalled fruit wines is also entirely questionable as is the reports general approach in relation to must

the role of the commission is that of monitoring the application of community law
an initiative for young people is to be held in brussels on 10 july giving them a chance to discuss road safety and a series of events on road safety will take place during the french presidency the most important of which will be held in paris on 13 october although there will also be events geared towards action in this sector in other european cities with a view to raising public awareness and in particular the awareness of young people
the fiscal social and salary conditions are still very disparate due to the absence of sufficient harmonization and i am afraid they will remain the same in 2014 as well
that is all the more regrettable since our trade disputes could have been effectively prevented by the early warning system within the tabd and the legislators dialogue
the thought of commissioner kyprianou having to spend his last penny on tests made necessary by that industry is deplorable
that at the moment is not on the agenda and has to be dealt with in a sectorspecific way it is for that reason that the commission needs to get around to taking action on this
we also have to recognise that many terrorist organisations are involved in racketeering drug smuggling and many other forms of normal criminal activity

madam president ladies and gentlemen this is a report about terrorism
clearly however for us this european constitutional process is not yet finished
on a more prominent political note we regret the fact that this agreement as also unacceptably happened in the case of fisheries does not explicitly make it clear that territory under the jurisdiction of the kingdom of morocco means territory under moroccan sovereignty in accordance with international law thus ensuring respect for international law and the legitimate and inalienable rights of the saharan people
that is the aim of this postponement
in my view the measure discussed in the report deals with european terrorism not just that despicable method which i regret to say is developing in presentday spain for if we can call that method despicable then we must see the methods used in other european countries by movements with much more dubious aims as just as contemptible
when one thinks about it and since you are the president of everybody i would be grateful if you would take some notice of them as well one realises that many of the cleaning staff are second generation immigrants
china has been able through dialogue to resolve the issue of macao

finally we would have welcomed something that picked up on the sustainable development strategy as regards the issue of targeted training for professions in helping to meet climate change requirements
we had this same problem last year with the directive on the marketing of safe products or unsafe products when the amendment we requested to prevent the exportation of organisms or products to the third world which are not accepted in the european union was not approved
what does the commission say now

in any case the continuation of this important process demands further efforts at every level
three years later there was sedan
constitutional guarantees such as the muslim marriage law which upholds the traditions of indian muslims are an expression of indias religious freedom and freedom of opinion

they wanted to know whether their spouses or their partners would be able to work they wanted to know what access to education their children would have and they also wanted to know which of their children were not going to be allowed in and were maybe going to have to stay with other relatives while they did exams at the ages of fifteen sixteen and so forth so if the european union is serious in what it is saying about labour market flexibility and the need for workers of certain categories we have to think very carefully whether we are going to say to the people that we want to come to work as company directors doctors it specialists chefs or whatever well sorry you need to split your family up you will need to wait for up to three years before you can bring them in
if the tftp is to be of use to the eu and the member states the us must continue to provide the respective authorised authorities within the eu with information from the tftp in the same way as previously

this itself is graphic testimony to the abject failure of the measures thus far implemented
it has also worked with groups pursuing violence in iraq
on the contrary all these measures will benefit smokers as well

the line between product placement and production aid is very thin and that will make doubt and controversy inevitable
however the result could mean the inclusion in the eu of a closed area for all communications with the north have been cut except with turkey where human rights are not respected the european court condemned turkey on 10 may for its behaviour in cyprus and where the economic situation is completely unregulated

i can give you a very precise example of one area in which we and bulgaria and romania have an interest in the countries fulfilling the conditions by the accession date and that is that community money should be properly spent and accounted for which i trust is close to the heart of this house at least it was when i was a member of the committee on budgetary control

coming from a country with a rich cultural tradition which has always seen itself as having european values at its heart i can only be inspired by the principles that are the very foundation of the european parliament and which are safeguarded by you the parliamentarians

at all events we aim to continue working in that direction
this annual review is presented in an annual report in accordance with operative provision no 8
may i say there is not just agreement but a fair and wellbalanced agreement
another potential problem is the way in which the report deals with member states where there is more than one official language
mr president ladies and gentlemen i would like to take the floor to protest against the abuse levelled at the european union by the cuban dictator fidel castro during a rally a very short time ago
that is what clearly emerges from the various reports which i believe provide a sound basis for our exchange of views today
the designation substances and preparations by no means covers the use of cmr substances in consumer products that is to say in those products with which we as consumers in the first place come into contact and through which we are exposed to these dangerous substances for example when we buy toys textiles new flooring etc the directive does not then cover the main source of what we are exposed to that is to say carcinogens and other dangerous substances
anyone who disagrees with this constitution will need to explain to themselves and everyone else why and how the present treaty protects their reasons for disagreement better than our constitution because we shall continue to function it will merely be with the treaty of nice

what does the commission intend to do and what initiatives does it have underway to enable the broadening of the doha round in order to get us away from this tiresome situation in which we are all sitting around and reproaching everyone over agricultural trade agricultural trade and only agricultural trade when we know that what the world economy needs is a very much broader trading agenda that also includes trade in services and industrial trade
all these worthy objectives are included in the lisbon strategy however we have to admit that we are in the third year and in certain sectors such as education for example things are not going quite according to plan
this is something for which this house has repeatedly asked

i therefore feel that there is no more time to waste and we need real changes and a harmonised european roma policy
i apologise how could i have failed to recognise you
over time the various voting values tend to consolidate deficient corporate structures

there has been no need for red cards to be given out to use a football metaphor which is clear evidence that our joint effort has been carried out in a spirit of sincere friendship
i think this will be important
i am therefore very disappointed that zimbabwe is still despite the misery befalling the country involved in the war in the democratic republic of congo

in the case of both products there is a need to prevent illegal plundering and to establish sustainable resource management
without the unstinting commitment of rescue workers including volunteers from neighbouring countries this type of earthquake disaster is almost impossible to cope with for only swift assistance is helpful
the new resolution also restored unity in the international community and moreover made it possible for the un to again become involved in iraq which is an important step certainly in view the elections to be held in january 2005

we are highly committed to raising awareness and reinforcing policy means in order to provide quality services for those in need of assistance

on behalf of the vertsale group es the human rights council was created as a replacement for the human rights commission and was faced with the by no means easy challenge of not falling into excessive politicisation and governmental interference in such an important area as overseeing universal respect for human rights

china has in the meantime adopted and implemented as of 1 april 2008 its own aeo legislation that appears very similar to the european community concept
here i would also like to congratulate the austrian presidency on all of the measures it has taken in this respect
i agree very much with mr laschet that the increase in tacis is important inter alia for reasons of stepping up our presence in general in that region
that is exactly the way presidentbarroso and i see it

to read out every amendment result would be very timeconsuming especially with a vote like we have today
in that respect we are confident that you as a man of the mountains will help us on this important issue
however what does arouse total opposition is the suggested cure which is to restrict the budget deficits of the member states and to standardise their financial policies
we must give ourselves the resources to act quickly and in a coordinated manner for the benefit of course of commercial interests but also in the interest of freedom of circulation which is a global principle and finally for the benefit of our humanitarian objectives
that would not be a good thing
the budget year 2003 will then have further challenges in store not only for the candidate states but also for all the european institutions that need to prepare themselves
latvia and our region will be the bridge to the east just as the mediterranean states will join both shores of that sea
mr president ladies and gentlemen my colleagues from the committee on employment and social affairs have touched a raw nerve with their reports and have made it clear how essential joint action by the member states and the european union is to ensure that the consequences of the global economic and financial crisis are not borne by those who are worst affected by it namely those on the bottom rungs of societys ladder
is that really our aim
you raised the issue of qualified majority voting
how can we safeguard viable pensions
those who do not treat the stability and growth pact as a fetish have been waiting for this moment for a long time
mr president the proposal for a directive setting standards of quality and safety for the collection testing processing storage and distribution of human blood and blood components has come at exactly the right time given recent developments in the medical and public health sectors

this is where sports clubs can play a complementary supporting role for schools
if we are not capable of bringing pressure to bear upon the governments of member states to transpose union legislation correctly we cannot expect people to believe that union institutions such as the commission the council or the european parliament will effectively defend citizens rights derived from union law
perhaps i can remind you here that this independence of the central bank this irresponsibility that we see at work every day was organised and formalised by the maastricht treaty
we should establish proportionate and loopholefree rules to apply fairly and uniformly across the whole of european business and industry
i have also discussed this matter with the rapporteur
i also welcome the measures proposed by the commission but they must be accompanied by political action
the russian defence minister has said that this nuclear test makes north korea the de facto ninth nuclear power joining the usa russia china france the united kingdom israel india and pakistan

i think that the view being taken namely the belief that a european democracy or a european public can be brought about through european parties is quite wrong in a democratic perspective
what this is about commissioner is good governance
this advance was due to mr costas efforts until the very last second
i say this only as a warning
amendments 2 3 and 4 expand on or slightly strengthen the existing provisions and are acceptable to the commission
the highlevel panel appointed by the secretarygeneral will address this question among others
indeed i welcome the fact that in the 21st century people can make individual decisions about their own lives and divorce may be part and parcel of this
more and more people are now feeling that quite the opposite is true that europes economic progress is benefiting a few large conglomerates certain insurance companies hedge funds and large enterprises but not the people

the next item is the report a600512004 by mrslambert on behalf of the committee on civil liberties justice and home affairs on asylum procedure and protection in regions of origin 20042121ini
in addition we already have a distinct distortion of the internal market because at least five member states have already implemented a ban and others are planning to do so
liberals and democrats will be particularly vigilant in ensuring that measures to make us safer in europe do not erode our fundamental freedoms
the liberalisation policies encouraged by the wto to open up the markets of developing countries pose a serious threat to countries that are already weak as does the ever present reality of debt
i am raising this matter today because two new ships are out for tender and it is important that the next competition be based on a level playing field
in the most recent brutal attacks two soldiers just about to go to afghanistan were murdered as well as one police officer
it is clear that every solution must be acceptable to all parties and based on complete respect for fundamental democratic principles and human rights
i cannot however in any way see how her efforts might bear fruit as the commission is expressly saying that only those countries that have more stringent rules now may be given permission to stick to those rules
the commission cannot accept the rest of the amendments 25 namely amendments 1 3 4 5 7 9 16 17 22 27 29 30 31 32 33 38 44 45 47 48 49 53 57 58 and 59

on the motion tabled by our philanthropic missionaries regarding free postal services for the visually impaired i personally do not see why wealthy people with impaired vision should send their mail free of charge at the taxpayers expense
this is a serious problem throughout subsaharan africa
i am not going to apologise for that because i believe the british economy is better off outside the eurozone and our significantly higher growth rate compared to the average eurozone country bears this out
it is rather a bad parliamentary habit and we should try to resist these headlinegrabbing temptations
the belorussian bridge would be needed by all three sides and profitable for belarus itself

i therefore say to the rapporteur praise where praise is due
if we want to have a strong presence at an international summit and demand measures which will benefit our mountains we must start by doing our homework in our own countries
such an approach can only serve to strip the cartagena protocol of its meaning at the very time when its ratification by the member states is underway
the commission is indeed very behind and we can only wonder what this means
mountainous regions will only remain open if everything possible is done to offer those who have chosen to live there prospects for the future particularly young people
today we are being asked to consider the future development of our planet
if not why is the council advocating maintaining a sugar scheme which has been strongly criticised by the court of auditors and which has negative effects on consumers and thirdworld producers

that starts in my view with good clear drafting of laws highquality impact assessments and effective comprehensive and transparent stakeholder consultation
all this obviously creates genuine legal insecurity for all the institutions countries and peoples
there should be routes for legal migration a crackdown on peoplesmuggling and reform of our farm policy to kickstart growth in the countries of origin

how will you commissioner be preparing yourself for the event in kazakhstan
i find two key words in this report risk and security
we do not yet have the same kind of mechanisms as those embedded in the cotonou agreement where we have a negotiated relationship but this whole discussion is clearly an important element in the ongoing dialogue with all our partner countries
as everyone agrees this is essential because of the challenges presented by enlargement
greed instead of care for the environment has become the defining feature of our strategy for tackling climate change and the race to biofuels is potentially threatening the lives of millions of people as the global population soars from its present six billion to an estimated nine billion by 2050
but 17 billion people have no access to clean drinking water and as many as three billion have no access to sanitary facilities
europe has not done enough to press china and india to stop supporting in one way or another the burmese oppressors
the new programme like the old one aims to reduce congestion on the road network to improve the environmental performance of the transport system and to strengthen intermodal transport in order to contribute to the implementation of an effective and sustainable transport system

in this house we have adopted 11 reports on the subject of gender equality over the last five years

in view of the ambitious aims the european union has set itself the further reduction in the already low budget for 2009 by the council is surprising
long after peace has been concluded and i hope that even in angola that will one day be the case there will still be fields that cannot be walked on because they are full of mines and therefore put innocent people are at risk

it is all too often the case for example in my country that the investigating party pays an extraordinarily high price and the tortured judicial course ends in an acquittal

we must also ask ourselves what exactly we want to say about the future of europe and above all how this message relates to the action which the european union has taken
it is unclear for what reason this industrial sector deserves to receive support
this is why it is necessary for us to give industry a chance at intelligent development that responds to our goals
ladies and gentlemen the council has accepted the essential points of the report passed by this house at first reading stage
once broadband is available the connections can be very good in some of the most rural areas we have in the european union
on the other hand it is of some comfort that the result of the survey suggests an improvement in the situation in comparison with the survey of 1999 but it is worrying that this situation is continuing 15 years after a constitutional text in its marvellous article 14 declared that all spaniards in this case are equal before the law and that there could be no discrimination on the grounds of race sex etc
we have the case of liberia for example which is also currently experiencing civil war
it would be even more preferable for laws respecting the principles of transparency proportionality and consistency to regulate the basic points of a sector and make provision for implementing measures which also relate to the technical details

commissioner you are appearing before the european parliament with a proposal which demonstrates that the european commission has failed in relation to managing the common fisheries policy

i agree with helmut kohl who along with françois mitterrand and jacques delors and others we just saw jacques santer in the film contributed to the ultimate introduction of the euro when he said in 1998 that a currency is of course a means of payment
it is time to remember that the member states are the ones which organise ratify and write these conventions and that they may have now decided to reach a political position which is certainly more logical coordinated and above all more responsible in this field
the commission calls this flexicurity
a large amount of food is exported into the european market from such countries
i voted in favour of mr hammerstein mintzs report on the openness of meetings of the council when acting in its legislative capacity
can i just suggest that we could make a great start by enforcing the ban here in our own parliament buildings
but unfortunately we do not have the possibility to go further and examine the data as such
the positive role of physical exercise as a basis for mental and physical wellbeing is now becoming common knowledge throughout europe
there is a long road to travel before we get that far
the weighting between these three different areas is 25 on area 25 on production and 50 on the budget for the envelopes and the transfer into the rural development policy
the intention that this agreement should become a model for other states in which critical people feel unsafe is even more controversial
mr president contrary to our polish friends opinion there are not in europe two legal doctrines as to whether the end justifies the means
we also need to remember all the victims of dictatorships however and therefore i would ask you to support amendments 54 and 55 by my group
lastly our parliament i believe condemns the death penalty no matter who it affects children women adults or which country in the world carries it out
quite apart from the disasters we must not forget the mess that is made in european coastal waters on a daily basis
we shall try to take a delegation to skopje before the summer
we should always err on the side of caution when dealing with delicate matters given the commission s role and the nature of the issues it is dealing with at present indeed the latter will become increasingly delicate and varied as the building of europe proceeds
why
examples of cooperation initiatives under consideration include support for improving the investigative capacity of the nigerian police access to justice and support for prison reform support for anticorruption efforts support for the democratic process and support for federal institutions dealing with human trafficking illicit drugs human rights and counterfeited medicines
as far as i am concerned this is not a good idea
this rejection must be used as an opportunity to restate our position
since swift is moving its database from the us to europe at the end of the year it is essential that the eu concludes a shortterm agreement with the us as soon as possible so that there is no risk of the exchange of information being interrupted
applause
so i think the member states must face up to their responsibility here and do so at european level
i wish to extend special thanks to the chairman of the committee on agriculture and rural development mr parish and our coordinator mr goepel for their support and confidence
madam president ladies and gentlemen in conclusion the commission agrees with the principles set out in the excellent report by mr watson whom i wish to warmly congratulate and with the guidelines contained in the draft recommendation that parliament is considering today
we hope that the european parliament will become ever more involved in protecting these rights and above all we are pleased to support the idea of continuous monitoring of all the legislative activities that will lead to such protection which as the commissioner was saying could culminate in a final report
it has passed the first test and has provided a unique contribution to the permanent integration of our nations in europe
i do not like to speak in terms of money when we are talking about the value of nature but the centre for environmental studies estimated that the loss of revenue suffered by commercial fishing and tourism was around eur18million in hungary alone not including the loss of natural heritage or environmental damage
the inclusion in the proposal of international regulations on the transport of dangerous goods makes the directive a consolidated document of international scope
as soon as the ban is introduced therefore it will undoubtedly deal a severe blow to this hunting and to the international trade in seal products
this is a reasonable compromise
do you realise that when you prohibit modernisation you also prohibit the sustainability of fishing a form of fishing that is more respectful of the environment of those fishing grounds that fishermen have most interest in respecting
us officials say this new strategy has emerged after months of review
i thank the danish presidency very much
this is why i have tabled an amendment referring to the fact that this risk is also present in other countries because the wording would otherwise have amounted to discrimination against poland
today wars are still being fought over oil as in the gulf but violent conflicts are already emerging on the horizon over water
there is however something both countries have in common namely russias strategic interest
the internal market has given consumers the opportunity to expand their horizons enormously and they no longer rely on what is on offer within the national market
there are also big regional differences within europe
the issue of european citizenship very much revolves around the way in which the institutions promote peoples interest in european policy
in this respect i naturally wanted to say that we support this report but that we also feel that the subject of the relationship with the primary committee remains a thorny topic in the corbett reform and at this point i also would like to say something to mr botopoulos it is not that the committee on petitions is a strange committee it is a committee that has a very specific role and on most occasions petitions are concerned with the application of community law they are concerned with breaches of directives and laws that do not evidently always have a very clear relationship with the primary committee
we would have liked the constitution to incorporate a reference to our judaeochristian heritage
mrpresident commissioner ladies and gentlemen the report by mrry whom i would like at this point to congratulate on his work could turn out to be a real boon for european workers
mr president ladies and gentlemen honoured visitors the purpose of this reform of the block exemption regulation is to reregulate the motor vehicle industry in the european union
under this proposal however it would instead be maltese law that applied
as far as we are concerned making the world more democratic starting with europe of course is the leitmotif
however parliament as colegislator should also claim to have a role in interpretations if there really are problems with the directive
that is another important point to look at in the future
from the economic and financial crisis to energy security and climate change the presidency has been steadfast and clear in its objectives and it has offered europe clear leadership in testing times
we have not finished yet but things are moving
as you have gone this far why not the taliban hezbollah or the tamil tigers
secondly the community made a formal undertaking in dakar last year by backing the vision of the world declaration on education for all based on the universal declaration of human rights and the convention on the rights of the child which states that education is a human right
this was the case for the report for which i was responsible
only independent and free media coverage of the electoral process can ensure free fair and transparent elections
in this respect we have all seen here in strasbourg and in brussels the quality of preparation for this sixmonth presidency and the extent to which the members of the french government make themselves available
yesterday he said the following in the nrchandelsblad yes this basis is not convincing but i do not doubt the coalitions moral justification of this action for a moment i do not doubt it for a moment
it must be our task to ensure that there are
mrs ksné kovcss report on the social situation of the roma and improving their access to the labour market in the eu reflects the high level of political responsibility the european parliament has towards the citizens of europe at the height of the global economic crisis
i urge you commissioner to adopt a policy that addresses this issue as a whole
greater transparency equals better democracy
i welcome for example the ferrari report adopted today in parliament which offers greater protection to pedestrians and cyclists
as such i should like to deliver a few messages about this report the essential aim of which is to emphasise that the implementation of community law forms an important part of the better lawmaking dossier alongside the other issues that we shall debate this afternoon
finally i regret that during the consultation meeting of 20 july no agreement was reached concerning the amount of appropriations that need to be earmarked for the common foreign and security policy
so we must send a united message without amendments that would undermine and weaken this resolution which only covers the humanitarian issues of ashraf residents
the approach taken to the subject ignores class differences and includes only what happens in the dominant class
as a result in the measures it puts forward the report continually proposes something that i find unacceptable a compulsory quota system with penalties for parties while ignoring the fact that the problems and constraints that exist include for instance the economic and social conditions on the ground and the electoral systems themselves
mr president mrpoettering waited until the last minute
the effects of the policy of multilingualism are farreaching and obvious but if erroneously applied the results can be pitiful
mr president in conclusion i would like to mention at least four fundamental points in the interinstitutional agreement which we would like to enter into with you
moderate consumption of fermented drinks such as wine or beer by healthy adults is not only unharmful but even good for ones health and can form part of a balanced diet
the website is a potential tool for passing on such things too
these are new instruments and now it is not even mandatory to have authorisation from a countrys dictatorship to be able to disburse the funds
more and more stocks are threatened by collapse
my impression is that a number of other matters are involved the question whether it is legitimate to distribute taxpayers money to parties and through government impose rules on parties that strengthen the distrust of citizens of what they see as a political elite
i look back with pleasure on her tenacity during the trialogues
the risk is further increased in the wintertime by the serious problems of ice in northern sea areas
they need to be encouraged to use those quickly and you will need to produce clear and unambiguous guidelines on both sales and service
the fight against terrorism must of course also respect constitutional criteria otherwise it cannot be justified
moreover people do not know what service they can obtain
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
given the eus enthusiasm for harmonization i believe that a common language is a natural step on the road to a federal superstate
it is therefore a mistake to insist on decoupling aid from production and employment and it is unacceptable to continue to pursue a policy of support for largescale landowners and multinational food corporations whilst failing to value the farmers who maintain agricultural and livestock production on the basis of protecting biodiversity food safety and product quality
oswaldo pays situation is a scandal as is the hostile gesture the cuban regime has directed at this parliament
on behalf of the alde group mr president as the rapporteur is a member of my group and a close colleague the house will understand if i defend her agreement
every member state will set an individual ceiling for each of its farmers
only 22 of the officials in the top category are women

they were promised that they would not suffer on account of the rejection of the referendum in the greek part of cyprus
it is very sad that so far this house has been unable to ensure that all parliamentary assistants are properly paid and have adequate social security cover
secondly europe really can change things and make a contribution
i agree with the concerns of some members of the parliament regarding the role and participation of small and mediumsized enterprise but in fact smes do have the opportunity to join transnational consortia in which any kind of companies can participate
we must study the mechanisms which as you have said will provide us with a safety valve in the event that difficulties may arise in any member state in the future as a result of enlargement difficulties which will have to be resolved efficiently making full use of the procedures laid down in our treaty
at the same time however we are also involved with common challenges in our relationships with other countries
in the context of combating poverty we want 35 of funds go on health and social infrastructure education in particular but we note that the countries find it that much easier to spend their money on weapons
mr president i am going to ask two very short supplementary questions
this meeting takes place at a very important juncture in our relations
never mind transitional arrangements obey your own rules open your borders take your share of say polish workers in the united kingdom we have 250000 of them and they are not all plumbers
i cannot fail to observe though that there is nobody here to represent the council of ministers any more than there was when the president of the palestinian authority was speaking and i do not think it is acceptable that the council should fail to be represented at such an important debate
that is why elections must be held in kosovo without delay in order to strengthen mr rugova s position and make clear where the majority of albanians stand and where the democratic forces stand
what in practical terms is being done at european level
amongst those freedoms the freedom of movement of people is perhaps the most important
at the upper end of the gulf of finland another oil harbour is already being built which constitutes a threat to the safety of the entire sea
the enormous potential of small and mediumsized enterprises should be developed and incorporated into the document since smes represent over 90 per cent of enterprises in european economies and 79 per cent of employees belong to smes
diseases like alzheimers parkinsons diabetes heart disease and even cancer have yet to be fully challenged by the biotechnologists
can i take this opportunity to briefly express my concerns about the administration of eur 60 million of funds in northern ireland
i hope that the commission will ensure that good communication is established with society so that it is possible to seize the opportunities that present themselves
this means that we share responsibility to a large extent
now that we are members of the eu though we have to see that we put people before profits that persons come before directives
they reflect the compromise from the informal trialogue with the council
what justifies the fact that the spanish including the galician fleet is constantly subject to measures which restrict its activity on a pretext of resource conservation which does not apply to other countries
it requires a longer approach it requires more involvement of other presidencies it requires more involvement of other member states
rural development is therefore an important political area a fact that was reiterated in the conclusions of the lisbon march 2000 and gothenburg june 2001 european councils
it seems to me that parliament the commission and the kok working group all agree that real progress needs to be made
the regulation now in preparation aims to remedy this situation first of all by favouring an agreement between the parties
sudanese military and peacekeeping agents largely support the wellarmed chadian rebels in the border area between darfur and chad and in addition to the sudanese government they also get support from the arab militias in darfur
i look forward to cooperating closely with you mr dimas
a socalled reasoned opinion has been issued for almost one thousand of these and over 400 have been referred to the court of justice
in particular the ban on animal protein in feed must be retained
i also wish to thank mr lisi for his sterling work
the twentyseven member states are home to 500 million people who make up 8 of the worlds population and that percentage is tending to decrease
the european parliaments message is clear in future we the eu must not and cannot deal with the problem of earthquakes intermittently and peripherally we must focus on it as a distinct separate problem and examine all of its individual aspects and components
i wish them well
it is lamentable however that a report on the euafrican partnership should contain no word of mention about the problem of illegal immigration a problem which is so pressing for both europe and africa that leads to a brain drain from africa and causes so many social problems in europe
subject language learning in border regions
in order to facilitate an agreement within the icao on this point we are holding parallel discussions with the united states and with the developing countries
i hope that following this vote the legally binding nature of the charter once implemented will enable european citizens to directly and individually refer matters to the eus court of justice
do we really need to have 27 agencies because we shall have 27 member states
in fact for the 2005 budget the compromise reached by the consultations held on 25 november namely eur1063 billion in other words not 105 mrs guyquint but 1005 of gross national revenue is less than the commissions preliminary draft 109 billion which was itself less than the parliaments request in first reading 111 billion a request in turn less than the commitments made by the council the commission and parliament as part of the financial perspectives jointly set in 2000 which set the budget at 114 billion
i asked a very important question about human rights and democracy in british colonies
i feel it is most important that parliament and the european commission urge the authorities in spain state the united kingdom and gibraltar to create this shipping supervision and monitoring body
i think that we should emulate this approach where human rights violations within the european union are concerned and this is why my group will be giving mr syllas report its unqualified support
encouraging poorer countries to develop is an ideal shared by all of us particularly those on the left such as myself
as we know he always pays great attention to human rights issues and tragedies in africa
mr purvis s report is immensely enthusiastic on the subject of biotechnologies from which he expects wondrous benefits for mankind to be fair he does refer to the risks inherent in biotechnologies and to the ethical problems which they raise but i should like to draw your attention to the fact that so far these benefits have yet to be proven for now the benefits seem to be assets for the companies alone and the risks appear to be liabilities for our citizens and the environment
we are all involved in a conflict which is becoming increasingly horrific
the council common position is a realistic approach to the issue understanding the problems of the different member states and their regions
the european union is one of the most open markets while eminent partners of ours maintain high trade barriers
some of the members have already made proposals and i too would like to make some demands we must cling to the proposals of article 158 which the commissioner mentioned just now
several international organisations have voiced a great many reservations about the way the campaign was conducted a fact noted in key comments by previous speakers
hypocrisy
moreover it might not be so very silly to call mrs doris pack mrs stability pack i am sure she will not be offended
does it not show an exceptional lack of leadership and a failure to support and explain the advantages of enlargement
the sitting was suspended at 2220
mr president at a time when unemployment is high in the countries of the european union it is vital to draw up a european employment strategy
we urgently need this legislation on the quality and safety of tissues and cells across europe
agenda for next sitting see minutes
on the one hand the offer made by the european union covered all sectors and on the other hand mercosurs offer omitted sectors that are very important to the european union
in my view that country could have a great impact and if that country takes the new programme for african development the nepad programme seriously then south africa too should make more of an effort if it wants to count on aid from the european union for this important economic programme for africa
if we are to stay in the first thing that will be needed is a reshaping of the transatlantic relationship and the second will be a definition of the fields of action in which the european union has to assume responsibility in the context of security policy
i believe that as far as human rights in general in the world are concerned and i would single out in this broad category the rights of the child and womens rights there is still potential which has yet to be fully exploited in the decisions that we take regarding all the aid policies not least in respect of developing countries potential which we must exploit with greater determination and resolution to promote the need to respect human rights
you mentioned the ecchina joint customs committee
for an organization that seeks to erode the differences between nations and peoples the eu attaches a great deal of importance to linguistic nationalism
a crisis management concept was approved by the council on 5 august
hence here as elsewhere the role of our institutions is to maintain a simple substitute role wishing to be the manager of all whereas we ought to be the guarantors of little we should bear one thing in mind when dealing with space matters europe must first of all keep its feet on the ground
quite a few of the amendments we voted on today are however unnecessarily bureaucratic and the extra cost and the administrative burdens that these would entail are disproportionate to the potential benefits
mr president pursuant to rule166 of the rules of procedure of the european parliament i should like to enquire on what legal basis the miniature national flags were removed from the seats occupied by polish members from the league of polish families
this programme cannot however be implemented in the most effective way possible with the level of funding provided for by the commission
we also need to exert severe pressure on those countries which refuse to take back their own nationals
they must have been extremely disappointed with the results of the most recent summit
in this particular case the demarche was sent in june 2007
conclusions of the g8 meeting in genoa
i am not questioning the need for us to give this problem our urgent attention i am merely asking whether we are giving it thorough enough consideration and whether we are perhaps sometimes acting precipitately without asking the right questions
the principle must however be in place that the ombudsman has the right to see documents
very briefly here are a few shocking statistics annual carbon dioxide emissions from road traffic total 835 million tonnes 40 000 people die on the roads every year the costs associated with traffic congestion in the european union amount to eur 50 billion annually equivalent to 05 of the communitys gdp and this figure could rise to as much as 1 of eu gdp by 2010
that is the essential difference in my opinion
we therefore support this report but new tests should not be performed on finished products if known information on the ingredients they contain proves compliant with legislation
related to that point because some love to pass the parcel between national governments and the commission could the commissioner identify within the new package exactly those measures which are wholly dependent on member state contributions and any if there are any which are free of that
however i feel with the transition to the broader cips programme this objective seems to have been lost
the debate is closed
but we cannot of course say that it is in fact already a candidate for the simple reason that the copenhagen criteria are just not being met in macedonia
we hope india will react positively
other than that there is not a lot to say and even though one tends to want to exceed ones speaking time i can cut mine short in this case
is it not the case though that the situation will end up as it has in italy where the 2007 budget law favours those who are in a position to buy new vehicles and actually condemns precisely those who are least welloff who cannot afford to change their vehicles to a lack of mobility and heavy costs
of the 3 400 people living in the camp 1 015 hold residence permits from and enjoy resident status in different countries many of which are eu member states and we are not accepting these people
the eus competitiveness is deteriorating rather than improving
this was a very important and without doubt an historic step towards stability in the balkans as a whole
the further advantages of concluding the agreement such as creating jobs on fishing vessels in ports auctions processing factories shipyards and service industries both in the eu and in mauritius itself strike me as similarly beneficial
in this relationship with russia the eu is promoting such principles as market reciprocity fair transit conditions through russia and thirdparty access to infrastructure in russia
mr president the agreement with the council about the marco polo ii programme mainly translates into better access to this programme for smaller enterprises
this possibility was removed and i cannot understand why
i would also like to deal with a subject that for years has been close to mrsrothbehrendts heart
this is a scandal and this scandal must stop
this war is a disaster from the moral viewpoint
yes we have to protect the fragility of the arctic environment
it will of course be very difficult for the commission to respond to this especially the last one because there is only one employer in the commission namely the commission and it is not possible for example to stop payments for one or two dgs and continue to pay the others
the commission supports parliaments amendments aiming to ensure that spouses can make an enlightened choice
in so doing they not only contrive to ensure that europes real problems are pushed to one side but also place the polish people at real risk of terrorist attacks
however for me the most important issue is not that of the sign posts
the direction we must take is that of increasing payments and simplifying procedures
current regulations already provide the facility for reprogramming
perhaps the european public debate is waiting to be kicked into life
secondly it is asking for provision to be made in other sectors which use chromium vi in various products for legislative initiatives of the same kind as those that have been adopted for endoflife vehicles and for electrical and electronic equipment
it is telling that the berlin declaration signed by the 27 leaders makes no reference to the european constitution which is the main issue of concern to us
at the world conference on climate change last november for example the unions delegation sat in finlands place as finland held the presidency at the time
the result of the enlargement will therefore be that the number of member states which are eligible for financial support for their balance of payments will rise sharply
that is why i would like to clearly restate the key points of our common policy here in parliament
with regard to the energy and climate change package europe has set the tone and must not lose its advantage
we started with a very difficult background
both the development risks which are by definition unknown and cannot possibly be discovered on the basis of scientific knowledge and the permit defence will be included in the directive in the form of the entrepreneurs exemption of liability
speaking from the perspective of parliament we consider this parliamentary report prepared by mrs wortmannkool to be a worthy statement and report on this wideranging programme
the people who are pushing you to do that namely the british and polish governments will have to answer to their electorates for it
it is fitting that those who bore the burden of accession negotiations bear some of the fruit of their labours
during the last partsession i think i understood correctly that a large number of my fellow members wanted a general overhaul of the text rather than just technical improvements
i believe the most essential step was that we were able to agree in the council in november 2002 on the traceability and labelling of gmos
these are the two derogations to which the european parliaments resolution for which we voted today is most strongly opposed it disputes that the member states have any right to propose texts on the pretext that they would exercise this power in an uncoordinated manner it wishes the qualified majority system to apply more widely or perhaps totally this is not made quite clear a wish that would largely be granted by the treaty of nice if it is ratified
the commission thanks the rapporteur for the support given to the commission proposal
nevertheless i would like to point out that we attach great importance to this report as well as to the contributions made by the commission to improving the international panorama and we are clearly in favour of multilateralism as i have said previously although we believe that the situation puts excessive emphasis on antiterrorist aspects and does not give sufficient emphasis to better international cooperation aimed at eliminating the causes of inequality and injustice such as the democratic control by the un of agencies such as the world trade organisation the international monetary fund or the world bank which at the end of the day are the bodies which can create greater justice in the world
the report on which we must reach a decision on thursday attempts to respond in practical terms to the difficulties of millions of our citizens who are suffering increased food prices
we ought to be informed directly
therefore we emphasise that a solution to the internal crisis has to be found as quickly as possible by means of peaceful negotiations and that we are happy to be of assistance in seeking such a solution
if you are going to be doing all this research can you look into the indirect costs of running a small or mediumsized enterprise
this is precisely where we can demonstrate to the most sceptical that alone our member states even the biggest member states do not have the scale or the leverage to push the agenda forward
the murdering of opponents of the regime goes unpunished
mr president in the charter of fundamental rights which we all prize very highly and rightly so article 41 enshrines a right to good administration
i am not in a position to go further than the commissioner responsible herself but i can make it clear that we accept in principle the objectives of the amendment
on 3 april indias national human rights commission released the preliminary findings of its report on the violence a strong indictment of the failure of the gujarat government to contain the violence
i will go there and listen but at the same time everyone needs to understand that in the polls 80 of the people say that they are proeurope we can nevertheless work with them without threatening them
the proposal on the law applicable to contractual and noncontractual obligations could also have a positive effect on the resolution of very concrete very specific problems such as those related for example to road and river traffic or the management of airports located at the borders of several states such as the baselmulhousefreiburg airport
giving children a chance in life is an important mdg
more importantly the exploitation of the seas should be based on the known precautionary principles of environmental protection
our group saw it as crucial to substantially curtail the scope for exceptions in the negotiations and i am delighted with the present result a trade ban in which this objective has largely been realised
fr the erasmus world programme 20042008 is a positive initiative since it aims to strengthen the position of european universities at international level
this is done in the light of the declaration annexed to the amsterdam treaty the socalled nice declaration of the european council in 2000 and the white paper on sport which specifically mentions as action number 9 in the pierre de coubertin action plan to complete the analysis of rules requiring that teams include a certain quota of locally training players
that doctor said solvit has restored my confidence in the internal market
he said that the commission was raiding the main areas
just in case we have not got the balance right the board itself should be in a position to know whether it has been frustrated or not so there is a review clause after three years
the report insists on the need to speed up the liberalisation of telecommunications postal services energy and transport regardless of the consequences for employment regional cohesion working conditions and a highquality universal public service
what is worthy of note on the agricultural policy side is that there is no impact assessment accompanying the proposal
the guidelines constitute the main instrument for coordinating the economic policies of the member states in the effective manner that is required but in practice progress so far has been regrettably unsatisfactory
companies and competent national public authorities should carry out this control and certification as a preventative measure
member states also need to take steps to ensure that they are integrated into local planning and landuse decisions national regional and local authorities need amongst other things to introduce measures to improve the efficiency of water use and to encourage changes in agricultural practices necessary to protect water resources and quality
how can we stave off such a negative outcome
the constituent is whoever ratifies
since a huge number of those are active in the transport industry that is a major advance which is mainly attributable to projects being combined and a restriction of the financial and administrative burden
i would like to draw your attention to the fact that our competitors are not sitting back and doing nothing
it was extremely important looking ahead to the future as well that a decision was made from which lessons could be drawn because we preceded the preliminary draft budget by several months
subject european arrest warrant
in addition the text of the convention which was set up and operated utterly antidemocratically by muzzling every voice on the left does not crystallise the democratic rights won by the people
i addressed my concerns to the commission on 28october2004 for example and on 13december i asked the president to take action with a view to ensuring protective measures were put in place
the figure for lorries is 35 000 per year and that for buses 17 000 per year

so
i thank mr patten for his replies to members
needless to say we also condemn the attacks on journalists including russian tv journalists who tried to cover the demonstrations
this is what we have been working on up until now and what we hope to achieve with the next amendment
this is the core of the copenhagen criteria for eu accession
there are two further comments i would like to make on the questions that have cropped up
the only answer was that the council had not discussed this matter
many i expect will recall her direct and unpretentious personality and style
even more important is clear wording which assures us that another back door will not be opened
therefore i urge you all including europes budget and finance leaders who have spoken here today to try and as always to impress on your colleagues in the european parliament to vote positively and on thursday to approve the budget of the new europe the expanded europe of 27 countries
we will have to come back to it later
but the clock is ticking
my group proposes that we postpone this vote until there is evidence in israels policy and on the ground of these famous signs called for unanimously by the delegation representing our parliament a few months ago
i accept what she says in relation to the television without frontiers directive but i would ask her to keep a very close eye on this issue
this will involve bringing the term of office of the commission and the period covered by the financial framework more closely into line with one another
finally i can report to you that i have invited prime minister allawi to attend the european council on 5november
imagine colleagues that last autumn romanias interior minister had proposed detention of suspects for three months without charge or that the bulgarian prime minister had used the secret services to spy on his colleagues there would have been outrage
because i am sure that the success of this commission of this parliament and of the european project that we share depends on our showing that the european union can make a difference both within our borders and without
as such they require a robust response from all those who cherish democracy and international law
a head of state who plunges his own country into chaos and persecutes his own people does not really deserve our respect
these measures are also expected to have a favourable influence on international markets
true it is useful to have an energy policy that not only is as environmentally friendly as possible but also guarantees the energy supply that is crucial to our development something that in europe with all our political independence from noneuropean countries has so far been a distant prospect
europe must retain its leading role in the international struggle against climate change as president sarkozy also emphasised yesterday
of course without these arms those conflicts would not happen
this advantage consists in an extensive social programme making it possible for us to avoid investing such colossal sums in the social stabilisation of people who have got into problems
the wto forums offer the opportunity in joint consultation of reaching agreements that are fair for all partners
the stability pact is rather like the common fisheries policy every country has an interest in other countries keeping to the rules but in not being restricted itself
nl mr president with the lisbon strategy we are ensuring that europe is able to continue to compete with the rest of the world economically
it is found for example in car headrests and in the protective foam used for packing items of electrical and electronic equipment
in practical terms they are asking for a clear firm stand on the part of all eu members against the sustained involvement of iraqs neighbouring countries in the insidiouslygrowing terrorism on iraqi territory failing which the eu itself will eventually be called upon to foot the bill
of course this situation affects the pharmaceutical industry and authorities but it is patients who are primarily affected because these complex procedures delay them receiving the benefits of improved medicines
we are really going to come out into the open because at present no member of parliament is able to provide the list of all those people who work so hard to ensure that the european community functions properly
i would like to emphasise that i support all initiatives which aim to promote small businesses in the eu and to help those who want to be selfemployed
we shall be turning out en masse
in this context i am hopeful that improved broadband access will help stimulate small and mediumsized enterprises in rural areas
we have also agreed to follow the suggestion of the rapporteur mr casaca of starting a pilot scheme where recipients of payments are informed in writing as soon as the payment has been requested by the authorising officer this too will make for greater transparency

madampresident ladies and gentlemen i should like to express my particular thanks for the very constructive spirit that has characterised this debate and for the consensus that has emerged from it

we know that we are facing some very important challenges
this report which was a much amended report with approximately 106 amendments in committee shows two things
rapporteur de mr president i propose that we should adopt amendment 29 but also incorporate an element from the original text so that it would end up as an addition to the socialist amendment reading which make up the european identity as a combination of both drafts
that is why it seems to me essential that the community institutions as well as dealing with the constitution the euro and enlargement respond to what we european citizens in spain for example who live there consider to be our first priority the fight against terrorism that is the fight for freedom for respect for human rights and for the rule of law which we spaniards have built after four decades of dictatorship

sugar and preparations intended for human consumption
something that is extremely important is the rapporteurs warning that we need to redouble our efforts to train teachers because as the statistics show in some cases the resources are in place but almost no use is made of them
we on the other hand are waiting for a framework to establish how we should introduce such choices across europe
it is not for the commission to change the treaties and it has the obligation to apply them
nevertheless i would like to briefly use this opportunity to respond to what commissioner kallas talked about namely the commissions rejection of the proposed amendments regarding europol
that is why in my report i also welcome in detail all the commissions proposals

email marketing may well be the only form of marketing where the recipient carries most of the cost

moving on to the co2 debate i would like to ask what we are supposed to do when a barrel of crude oil sells in russia for 8 dollars and to heavy industry too whereas here one has to fork out anything up to 80 dollars and emission trading also means that we have to pay the co2 levy so that our energy and hence our raw materials industries are subject to double taxation
we take note of that but it is customary in this house for the texts of resolutions to be distributed to all who are mentioned in them

one example of this is as follows
there is very little information available about the participation of women inside the organisational structures and internal decisionmaking bodies of the social partners while even less information is available about the genderspecific composition of delegations of negotiators in the social dialogue
i like the rapporteur acknowledge that the commission proposal is acceptable because it undoubtedly represents a significant increase in the quality of community controls and procedures and demonstrates that the commission is already committed to this procedure
what then was the priority of the rapporteur
i hope that we will be in a position before the end of the year before winter in other words to grant the appropriations which are expected so that restoration repair and even prevention work can begin

you can read the real numbers of ships per member state on page 49 of the resource management regulation sir
certainly we must all put job creation at the top of our own agendas
the previous speakers have clearly shown the problems this creates for the environment and public health
in saying that i am also responding to mrwiersmas question
if europe is moving closer to an ever more effective unity what point can there be in fragmenting both languages which in actual fact are spoken across borders and other divisions
when we use the word investigation we need to understand what we are talking about
this should always be within the bounds of transparency and accountability
our committee chairman jan andersson was right to propose a text adopted by a large majority on the committee on employment in order to convey to all the committees particularly the committee on budgets that it was important to communicate with the member states so that every employee every member of a trade union and every member of the public can be informed in their own language of the existence of this european fund

i believe that is how we can genuinely give power to our tibetan friends and show our chinese friends that the rule of law is based on solid foundations of dialogue and not just on semblances of dialogue on the crumbs of dialogue that they throw to the tibetans and to us the europeans to make us believe as they have been doing for 40 years that they want dialogue while each time they reject real dialogue and any political solution

the main problems in the existing financial regulation are the constraints on how we are allowed to spend money
the rapporteur must be given credit for having cunningly hidden her real message behind technical nuances of meaning

we have already gone beyond the bestcase scenario as the war has already gone on longer than the usd 90 billion estimate assumed

nobody could then seriously foresee that these european communities would grow into an overarching cooperative of 27 or more european states

many people actually think the automobile sector is the biggest european industry but that is not true the food industry is the biggest one of all in europe
the smes of agriculture do not appear to have been protected or supported in the world of gm food production
as there are no problems we will deal with it this week
we should accept these levels both in the administration and in the political groups as they are tied to the better functioning of legislative activity making the lives of meps easier and improvements in the new comitology which should also be provided for in 2009
we know that if we had more money we could do more for europe with europe and in europe for all citizens

as you know joaquim miranda was the chairman of his political group the confederal group of the european united left between 1993 and 1994 and also chairman of parliaments committee on development between 1999 and 2004
ten member states have set a date of 2010 or earlier for switchoff whereas a further 10 have set a date of 2012
to do that it has to improve its model put in place a system of upwards social harmonisation put a stop to the dismantling of public services and reject a market europe
it is then the desire for effectiveness that motivates us and the commission must not be seen as any less interested in the joint effort towards winning the battle to keep the public properly informed
i think this consultation is essential in view of the importance of the erdf in correcting regional imbalances
the development of germanys economy will thus give the eu as a whole new momentum or at least that is my hope
from now on think before you speak
we also welcome the appointment of a permanent chairman of the eurogroup in the shape of mrjuncker which is a step in the right direction
that is of course the role of parliament
the agreement makes it quite clear that macedonia has european prospects
in my opinion this report should necessarily emphasize the following two issues the restrictions imposed on the new member states are not justified since their accession has not caused any imbalances on the markets of the other european union countries secondly these restrictions should not exceed the first two years specified by the european labour legislation
on behalf of the efd group mr president the proposal for the second reading of the 2010 budget still represents a 6 increase in respect of 2009
in this house we do not allow any kind of intimidation of other members
it would be highly irresponsible of us not to consider the aftermath even though we do not know how long the situation will go on for and not to consider who will pay for it all and what effect it will have on the euro zone and on the stability and growth pact and what chance it will give to countries such as my own to join and adopt the euro
the united states canada new zealand australia and our own united kingdom excelled in this sort of espionage by setting up chelon as our committee has confirmed thanks to the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur mr schmid and the coordinators

it is inconceivable that an attempt is now clearly being made to punish the bearer of those ill tidings the financial controller for what has happened here
obviously that is something on which the member states can act
should we for example provide needles to drug users who live on the streets
as you have been able to confirm in this parliament he is a statesman with strong democratic sentiments who understands european integration not as the oneway street controlled by the politicobureaucratic elites but as a complex process which will succeed only if it arises from the will of the people
naturally we must increase expenditure on the correct channels on innovation and on developments with a promising future but this does not change the fact that there is still expenditure that needs to be included in macroeconomic calculations

i also consider that an operator providing public services should be rewarded by the authorities and not as the authors of the report suggest merely compensated
my intention by replying is to reassure parliament of the commissions will and determination to apply the rules that we are approving with the support of the agency
first of all i am delighted that the amendments concerning the restoration of the preliminary draft budget have been adopted and i am even more delighted that the amendments concerning the increase in aid to the poorest people have been adopted food aid refunds for milk free distribution of fruit and vegetables promotion activities the distribution of milk to schoolchildren and aid for beekeeping
it is disappointing that so little progress has been recorded here
on the one hand there are those who believe the conventions draft should be left unaltered because it represents the only compromise possible then there are those who would like to throw everything up for discussion again because sovereignty is ultimately vested in the states and the last word should be theirs
the problem should therefore perhaps be split in two on the one hand states that may still have some imbalance in public spending but in the context of a stable economy and on the other those that have deficient social security systems and an economy in transition
we have a little left over every year and we should at last get around to using the money which remains for creating european added value in future
moreover the commission has always applied competition and market rules in such a way as to avoid the supply and development of high quality services of general interest being hindered
i do not think that that is what is happening now
at the moment progress is very variable in the different member states
in other words we do not need to question the market but we need to change the way we produce and consume energy inside the european union

i warmly welcome the fact that the report from the committee on legal affairs and the internal market before this house for debate reiterates strong support as we have heard from the rapporteurs for the overall reform package and does so in serious practical terms
first of all i am told that if there is no agreement there will be no growth
development of a comprehensive european strategy for regions with specific geographical features
to do so again would be the icing on the cake at the end of a long legislative process
we are also in favour of postponing discharge for the committee on the regions because it has still not satisfactorily resolved the repeated problems with expense accounts to which a solution must at last be found
agriculture is still polluting as a consequence of irrational use of fertilisers inadequate storage of animal manure and irrational use of land and i am referring especially to deforestation and overgrazing
the commission accepts parliaments amendments insofar as they correspond to the political agreement reached between parliament and the presidency and confirmed by coreper on 2may2005
i welcome as most people do the recent initiative by the g8 to implement further the process of debt relief for the third world

this is especially true in areas of high mining activity where it is not uncommon for various raw materials to have been mined for several hundred years

as to obtaining the certificate of professional competence the tran committee opted for eliminating a fixed number of training hours and replacing them with the obligation of a written examination followed by an oral examination as well according to the decision of each member state

it is about jobs and people
in the bge report on enlargement which we adopted in may of this year parliament asked the commission to outline agricultural policy after 2006 and what the expenses would roughly be
this is because the peaceful revolution which brought eastern europe into the democratic world the world of democracies originated precisely in poland as we all know with the work of solidarnosc and the election of a polish pope
quite apart from anything else these integrated guidelines are a step in this direction
that is the feeling
the parties and signatories not only need to put in place or adopt administrative procedures they also need to gain experience exchange it with other parties and learn from practice
i have met yawovi agboyibo several times personally in his home base
from now on the union s institutions particularly the representatives of the council and the commission will no longer be able to say that information reported in the media is inaccurate

my group will be voting for amendment 6 to replace the text of paragraph 5
where i come from there are many areas whereby they are being helped at the moment through existing funds but there are other areas where we could do more

we should not lose sight of the fact that notwithstanding the european employment strategy employment policy remains essentially a member state responsibility
the autonomy or independence of the kurds or of the other peoples living in iraq should be decided neither by a foreign power nor by representatives of the old or new regimes
we hope and trust mr verheugen that you will not return to parliament empty handed
there is also fisheries policy where our fishing quotas are still too high and we are endangering our fish stocks
but very briefly you spoke about the developing countries and you mentioned as part of that brazil and india
it is of course the commission that will submit proposals for this
the adoption of this report will enhance the european unions trade potential with regard to the design and manufacturing of clean vehicles
we know from all our inquiries that the enterprises themselves feel that the requirements of the financial authorities represent by far the most serious and heaviest burden so this is an area where it really is up to the member states to simplify matters
in those circumstances we have no option but to postpone discharge for the cor while an investigation by the court of auditors takes place to determine the exact nature of the problems
how far have we got with calculations and costs for the initiatives proposed previously
the commissions plan d is just that propaganda agitating and wheedling from top to bottom
mr president the eu budget for 2005 is now at second reading in parliament
sustainable development and respect for the environment are factors in economic growth
this brings me to the third message
thank you for the additional questions
that is all the more necessary on account of our impending enlargement and because the lisbon targets will of course soon have to be achieved in a much bigger european union and i think that it would be useful to keep an eye on that
i will discuss the latter project in more detail at a conference on an international day for missing children which will be held in brussels on 25 may and at the conference on the rights of the child to be held in berlin on 4 june 2007
mr president ladies and gentlemen there are aspects of your views that we share mr sarkozy and i should first like to go into some of these in more detail
absolute majority 285
i therefore believe we should all show solidarity and support this report
our next president should unite all elected representatives from national parliaments and the european parliament in moving lawmaking from behind closed doors into the open from civil servants to elected members
i am therefore pleased that the report of the committee on employment and social affairs underlines these two crucial elements and that the suggestion from my opinion by the committee on the internal market and consumer protection for a european initiative for chain responsibility has been adopted
it is just a question of getting them going
all the wto members now have an obligation to ensure that the agreements work in practice
here in parliament we have supported integrating the employment policy guidelines into the broad economic policy guidelines

on the other hand i welcome the fact that parliaments current position includes the pilot project that i presented for a fisheries market price observatory and continues to support the european maritime policy and all related projects by increasing the appropriations for research

which priorities would this involve
in my opinion it is extremely important to uphold consumer rights and that is what we are doing
it will probably be a very technical debate
however the basic philosophy of the new regulation is and i would like to reiterate this essentially to defend the interests of consumers not so much immediately because there is no guarantee that there will be instantaneous significant changes in vehicle prices that will benefit consumers but above all in the medium and longterm once all the rules for active competition enshrined in the regulation have been assimilated
despite the considerable number of new provisions many applicationrelated aspects have yet to be settled in order to make it feasible for reach to be properly implemented in certain sectors such as cosmetics for instance

there is no need for the ira to continue to exist
if we manage to do this in this crisis then the czech presidency will have met all our expectations in full regardless of what happens with the treaty of lisbon and the internal situation in the czech republic

we cannot allow a situation where two pirate mother ships sail happily along on these waters attacking our fishing and merchant vessels and we are for ever having to run round after them and watch to see how we can bring this under control

subject ccctb
mr president mr bolkestein mr lehne ladies and gentlemen i should like to make a few observations

lt minister at eu level the number of road accident fatalities is falling but the ambitious goals will not be achieved next year

the objectives of full employment education lifelong learning all of which have been cited are in fact parallel objectives which largely fall outside the scope of the guidelines for each sector alone

i very much hope contrary to what commissioner borg told us in his earlier remarks that tomorrow parliament will vote in favour of amendments 20 21 22 and 23 tabled by ms stihler and signed by 40 meps

cuba has been accepted as a member of the acp assembly but remains an observer on the joint committee
to close i am happy to announce that the commission can accept eight amendments in full and a further six amendments in principle or in part
i voted for amendments 33 and 223 because i consider that the liberalisation of the sector should not be abrupt and i rejected amendments 314 347 293 and 217 because i do not agree with the introduction of the possibility of continuing the procedure of enrichment with sugar a practice that could cause imbalances between producers and i therefore support the european commissions original text here
when stressing the need for a sufficiently confident and effective partnership with the member states i certainly do not mean that there should be in certain member states campaigns that are not coordinated and are not harmonized with those of other member states
we also agree that we need new money not a reallocation of existing aid budgets to offer any longterm support to help improve capacity and the quality of response in the regions of origin in full cooperation with the countries concerned

a code of conduct on arms exports was adopted five years ago under which member states set high common standards for the management of conventional arms transfers
if the changes made to the financial framework in connection with the recovery plan for the european economy leave very little funding in 2010 to cover the expected financial needs then i agree with the rapporteurs position that the multiannual financial framework currently in effect does not meet the european unions financial needs and also that the european commission should immediately put forward a proposal concerning an interim summary of the multiannual financial framework currently in effect

we do not spend money for the sake of spending money
when we consider these things in an ordinary way we think of financial support but in my view it is also necessary to provide some form of qualification since for families that have to assume such a responsibility it is very important to know something about basic nursing methods and the basic principles that are to be followed as well as the limits that such care can impose
it is the only specific question that i was asked and i will of course leave the rest to president sarkozy who is in a much better position than me to deal with them

it believes that parliaments contribution in an area such as the drugs issue is essential as a means of bringing european policy closer to the people
religious communities do not come onto the streets unless they believe that there is something radically wrong with a country
there is little to say except that everything seems to be going well in the sense that our citizens are more aware of the ombudsmans activities
we have also achieved a move from unanimity to qualified majority in many areas and this parliament will be involved in 70 of them when at the moment it is involved in 34
but we are working at the same time on the financial turmoil by following the road map that was adopted in october 2007 by ecofin

on behalf of the inddem group sv when eu countries exploit the natural resources of poorer countries they leave large footprints behind them
how on earth do you intend to get it across to the public that the commission has failed to make any real effort to put into effect things that should have been done in the past
the fact that he partially answered this question clearly shows that it is the commission as a whole that is worried about the development of our society and the commission as a whole that takes measures to move ahead in this area

we want you to come to our committees as you do to the committee on the environment public health and food safety
the statute should be revised so that the ombudsman is entitled to see each and every document before he has to pronounce upon a matter
this will be delivered i think in the parliamentary procedure in a very transparent and open way as it is in parliament
in my own member state citizens advice bureaux are acting as a clearinghouse
let us imagine the commission as santa claus and me as a little boy
after all we all know that if this parliament does not set a target we will not actually make any progress

this house has heard a great deal about the lisbon strategy and we would of course like it to succeed
i am optimistic

first of all the prime minister of my government has already indicated that he is reflecting on and will make proposals for a review of the way the g8 summit is organised
this should work as a very strong incentive to redress this shortcoming
the writedown in the case of special expenditure on innovation such as in company accounting that has been called for by some of my fellow members would open the way for further new debt and weaken the european economy dangerously in the long term

in a european union that was growing ever closer economically the creation of the euro was a logical development in strengthening the common market and simplifying trade within the internal market even so when the currencies of 11 sovereign states were replaced by a single currency 10 years ago there was a great deal of scepticism as to whether the planned single currency would be a success

thank you very much to the rapporteur
the council would therefore be willing and i use the conditional tense here to support an increase in european union development cooperation where cuba is concerned in the areas which could further the transition the path to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and in the areas which could improve the quality of life of the cuban people and therefore contribute to sustainable economic growth too
whilst those shortcomings may not change anything about their membership they will generate additional arguments against further enlargement

debates on cases of breaches of human rights democracy and the rule of lawdebate
i would describe the debate taking place here today on the common fisheries policy as backtofront or at least as putting the cart before the horse
in fact there seems to be a disconnection between the way the product itself is appreciating and the financial market that is based on that very same commodity
mr president commissioner mr solana ladies and gentlemen it is my belief that events in the current and previous year have made apparent our real need for clear thinking on this issue
our task as members of the european parliament is to see if we might play a role of some kind and then to offer our support and experience and in that way help resolve the conflict surrounding kashmir
parliament has before it a number of reports covering extremely important aspects of development policy
the report deplores the fact that the finnish presidencys efforts to find a solution to end the current stalemate to ensure full implementation of the additional protocol on the one hand and to reduce the isolation of the turkish cypriot community living in the north of the island on the other were unsuccessful
we have already consulted the council and i can see some scope that is if parliament dares take a qualified vote about a package i have distributed a moment ago for i see that as being after all a minimum requirement in the large groups
applause
the secretarygeneral has made clear his view that any changes must be a means to an end not an end in themselves
the state of interinstitutional inertia which this issue has reached leads me to address the following questions to the council and to the commission

however it is unfortunate that the maghreb countries as well as israel are strangely absent
this ambition must also translate into projects geared towards preventing transport
we are talking not about a future danger but about a present threat
people have followed this single currency project with no more than a critical eye
current circumstances do not in any case allow the latter to be a catalyst for development on its own for the very simple reason that we cannot pit economies and states in competition against each other when they have completely different structures in terms of production costs

we left many issues to one side but now we should perhaps revisit them

when it comes to these conditions parliament is the european commissions ally here rather than the council
the challenges in the human rights sector thus abound and this debate will certainly serve as a good basis on which the european union institutions can continue to do their work
it is a good proposal
it would be a misguided act
the lisbon strategy and the success of its updated expression are the basic parameter of the commissions choices and proposals in the contribution of the european union to the process of globalisation
turning to the substance of the various complaints they focus primarily on a lack of transparency and so in that the report repeats the ombudsmans demands made in his special report on the subject for all meetings of the council in its legislative capacity to be open to the public you have served the cause of democracy and transparency in europe well
my second remark concerns the storage of traffic data
for this reason the report calls for regional integration between developing countries and a model of symmetrical market opening so that the developed countries can dismantle their barriers to trade including nontariff barriers giving the countries of the southern hemisphere the time they need to step up their production make it more competitive and expand their markets
and i would like to congratulate the person who enabled us to carry out all these reforms and many others

pl commissioner i have the following request

i also wish to stress another aspect on which we often draw a blank

i congratulate the rapporteur mr csaba ry for his excellent work and would like to thank commissioner pidla for the summarising report which often provokes a dispute due to differing interests
we must understand that link and we must start doing something about it

that is not likely to prevent central europe from being the poor cousin of the west for a long time to come
in terms of the objectives in terms of what has been said about the activities that will contribute to achieving these objectives and the financial envelope that has been proposed which should focus on supporting practical initiatives that strengthen links between sport and education this initiative definitely warrants our support and so i have voted for it
you should raise the matter again when mr pttering is in the chair
profit made directly or indirectly from trade in human organs cells or tissues is one of the most despicable manifestations of this system an expression of the fact that society has not come out of barbarism
that is nothing exceptional
my second point is that if you analyse what is going on there now we have every reason to criticise putins policy on chechnya in recent years but the underlying character of this attack has nothing to do with chechnya
i therefore call on the council and the commission to take adequate preventive steps to prevent the spread of footandmouth disease in continental europe so that humans and animals are spared unnecessary suffering

i am very pleased to note that in relation to the second year 2010 of funding of the recovery plan for the european economy a result was achieved in the conciliation committee through the investigation of the 20072013 financial framework and a transfer of funds which guarantees funding amounting to eur 24 billion for next year and also makes it possible to implement the objectives specified in the economic recovery plan

madam president i rise to support my colleague zbigniew zaleski
constitutions are based on confidence in the future and with this constitution the citizens of europe are linking their destinies to create a better future

we have spoken out against protectionism and established the internal market as one of europes important achievements and one which also needs to be preserved at a time of crisis
it is true that we grant macrofinancial aid to certain third countries with difficulties
generally speaking the eu budget in its present format cannot deal efficiently and effectively with issues related to climate change
the budgetary ceilings for foreign policy go on being too restrictive and every year we have to fight to fund new priorities
this is of course based on international conventions and is a bilateral issue between the two member states
i would like to spell out some home truths about the relationship between the lisbon strategy the environment and the social framework
for this reason consumer protection matters at least as much
however we will not be taken seriously on matters of discipline and neither will we be taken seriously on matters of european integration

nl mr president the report on policy priorities in the fight against illegal immigration of third country nationals that we have just approved is certainly not the worst report that has ever been passed here and it does in fact contain a number of very interesting recommendations but i still think that the report fails to clearly tell the whole story and so i have not approved it myself
that certainly did not make our life very easy
of course i understand israels nervousness about taking the first steps
there are numerous specific requests and demands to take the risks seriously the drifting apart of the national economies which is associated with considerable risks in connection with the growth of wages and with budget deficits should not be concealed on this anniversary
on behalf of the guengl group de mr president north koreas nuclear test is quite clearly deserving of condemnation for it makes the region even less stable and like every other of its kind exposes the people who live there to the risk of radioactive fallout

lifelong learning and the development of peoples skills are necessary if everyone is to be able to give a good account of themselves in the face of global competition

what does this say about eu motives
mr president i shall now ask you to address our parliament

on the other hand i think that open coordination should continue to be intergovernmental and it must be flexible
council regulation no 97598ec determines the nominal values and technical specifications of the coins that can be issued by the member states
there is of course a good deal more underlying this summit
it is the profound belief of the commission that the union should promote an active dialogue with bona fide organisations which peacefully exercise their rights to freely express opinion and assemble

this is something that has to be considered in connection with the practical application of the proposal once it has properly entered into force

i would like if i may to go back over a number of points made in the opinion of the committee on fisheries

the main road i must insist is the one that leads on firmly towards training schools and research to give everyone the means to grow and to take part in active citizenship so that social protection does not turn into a benefits culture
i would not wish obama enthusiasts to suffer any early disappointment

those member states that produce concrete results will be the guiding light for the others to follow
two wrongs never make a right but create new oppressions and divisions in society
these tasks comply with the agencys regulation even though they are not specifically mentioned because the latest amendment dates back to 2004 but they will certainly be included in the next revision of the regulation which is currently being prepared

gm the united states and sweden have been mentioned in the debate today

these are unacceptable conditions but i must not waste any more time talking about this right now
his characteristic eloquence will be sadly missed on all sides of this house
what the commission presented on that occasion did not correspond to what had been agreed in the budget
on this last point we are rather concerned commissioner because we are seeing the council link the adoption of the regulations to the adoption of a new pension scheme whereas you yourself have not yet said anything precise about pensions and we know how explosive this issue is

it is a quarter of a century since we set our targets
first of all finding areas or levels of relative lack of success does not wipe out the successes achieved or the crucial importance of the international prohibition framework that has been adopted as a global security network secondly finding areas of lack of success because we want to improve efficiency levels is not the same as publicising failures in order to inspire and nurture a surrender to this global threat and thirdly detecting any failure is therefore only useful if it comes with a serious diagnosis of its causes so as to strengthen resolve even further at the next stage
the subject is at the heart of the global strategy that we in our committee discuss on poverty
dear mr cox congratulations on your victory
the eu must therefore continue to work in the spirit of the kyoto protocol which has led us to bank on technological innovation
i sincerely hope the commission will back our amendment despite what the commissioner just said and help us convince the council that something must be done
one of the draft recommendations accepted in 2005 was a case in which the commission granted ex gratia compensation to a complainant whose project it had cancelled at extremely short notice

if we take a look at these figures we can see that eur 112 billion remains below the payment ceiling for the multiannual financial framework

i also welcome the abolition of degressivity
we began by asking europol what it would do with this 5 million and after some time we finally received a response whereby europol realistically and pragmatically told us that it wanted to use eur 3 400 000 out of the 5 million in order as part of the fight against terrorism to create a database and improve the communication systems between the security forces and intelligence services
i would suggest that you ask the bureau to remit it to the relevant committee and we will consider it for a future voting session if that is acceptable to the house

the old suharto regime has in the past forced more than 8 million indonesians to move from overpopulated regions to regions with a low population rate

that is why the issue that we are now focusing on through the eurofor mechanism is not only the stability and protection of the refugees from sudan who have come into chad over a quarter of million of whom nearly 10 000 came in the last month and also refugees coming from the central african republic but to try and ensure that democracy and the democratisation of the issue are brought to the forefront as well
i also said that the present confrontation between parliament and the incoming commission can also be seen as evidence of a european democracy that is reaching maturity and that i naturally have every confidence that the position that your house will adopt will be well thoughtout
this text is a joint text adopted by most political groups and it is balanced
as you may know the outermost regions can also benefit from specific measures which aim at supporting traditional sectors of these regions

we should also not forget that it is in the fundamental interest of aging europe to make sure it is populated not by unfortunate people who depend on social assistance but by well educated working citizens capable of paying tax social contributions and insurance

also in the pipeline is our social agenda

these two systems cannot exist because the optout regime will override any optin systems
globalisation the expanding network of relationships and increasing interdependence among the peoples of the modern world is having the effect of bringing the world ever closer together due to the rapid development of technology transport telecommunications and computer science
i would like to conclude by saying that euindia relations are improving all the time
these 10 requirements can be summarised in just two greater payments and aid for our fishermen and sanctions for offenders
the new constitution contains a new pledge in article 2 and article 3 namely sustainable development justice security and solidarity for europes citizens
you are nevertheless in a position to prevent further damage and accept the proposal our representatives will take to the tripartite dialogue tomorrow
the same applies for that matter to all manner of extra services and insurance that customers have to explicitly request
a number of defined benefit pension schemes took advantage of the 1990s bull market to reduce the level of contributions or even take contribution holidays instead of building up their financial reserves
this approach also involves the idea of the minimal state and the greater efficiency of the private sector with the aim of imposing acceptance of socalled wage restraint which actually results in low nominal wage rises and even a reduction in real wages as the portuguese case regrettably clearly demonstrates
i did so not because i do not consider the military excesses that have struck at civilian populations to deserve condemnation but because i feel that the overall content of the statement includes some highly negative terms for the state of israel which has been the victim of constant terrorist attacks
i would be obliged to you if having heard all the members of this house you would tell that to mr liikanen as well
ladies and gentlemen it is absurd to think that the european union can teach brazil anything about the importance of mercosur or appoint itself mercosurs champion before brazil
motion for a resolution b503412001 on the report on the future objectives of education and training systems
thank you very much
i will just mention a few of the priorities
they sustain environmental sustainability
as everybody knows naples is famous for the film the four days of naples in which the local people rise up against the foreign invaders
likewise continued practice in europes protectionist systems will mean defeat in the most competitive matches played away on hostile global playing fields
the solution laid down in compromise amendment no 46 adds that in accordance with the decisions of the european court of human rights these measures must be appropriate and proportionate within a democratic society that data retention is only admissible for a limited period and that the legislation on the subject must comply with the principles contained in article 6 of the treaty on european union and therefore in particular with those enshrined in the european convention on human rights and in the shared constitutional traditions of the member states which are now these traditions included in the european union charter of fundamental rights
i also question the success of certificate trading with its covert development aid which certainly will not reduce the total volume of emissions but might redistribute it at best
we need a new chemicals policy
at present such companies and their drivers are escaping prosecution for offences caused for example in the united kingdom as the paperwork required to bring them to justice is currently too great
i would like to remind you that on 16 may two spaniards miguel ngel lpez and edén galvn were detained in riga along with five portuguese for taking some latvian flags that were hanging from street lamps
we too by which i mean we austrians are of course just as much affected by this as any other member state infringement procedures have the same effect on us as on any of them
if it is not being implemented is it because it is unworkable
the commission must continue in this vein
the european union has not yet learned to deliver and manage its external assistance programmes efficiently or to properly spend the resources that have been allocated to these purposes
nl where human rights in the world are concerned the european union should play a leading role
you have plunged into a polemic with the president of the ecb and with two commissioners but they represent our union and the policies we have agreed
the question must therefore be asked as to why measures are not being taken to support this sector
then it will be for you commissioner vitorino to propose a text that you have already negotiated mainly with the spanish and french authorities
the commission and the council have tried to say a few things
my question is this what is the commission going to do
thank you very much mr solana
in addition to this there is our firm position on kyoto which despite united states resistance has allowed us to reach a solution in bonn
twentythree candidates are running for president of ukraine but in reality only a few are genuinely doing so
ices also recommended using relative targets such as fishing mortality instead of fixed ones such as biomass because they are less sensitive towards scientific uncertainty and the environmental variations affecting the stock
we are also holding talks with the economic and social partners to identify what further measures might be taken to encourage competitiveness in the sector
the constitution will mean a codified multiannual financial framework and i would like a common vision for the next programming period to be our first step on this path
it was for this reason that the leaders of lithuania estonia and georgia boycotted the ceremony
we have therefore voted against these amendments
mrpresident administrative expenditure has not of course been the most difficult aspect of this years budget negotiations especially since employees salary increases were clearly to remain below 1 this year instead of 26 as originally foreseen
in my country for example 52 of all work created over the last two years has been temporary work and that is unacceptable
the alde group expressly supports this proposal
the important thing is for europe to compete with them on a level of quality that is at least comparable
we need to create a simple flexible legislative framework so that all medicinal products whatever the procedure applied in authorising their marketing are subject to the same evaluation and approval criteria
if we do not manage to have moral integrity we will not have the credibility that is required if we are to shape this process in a reasonable way
the preconditions for jobs are also clear
the improvement of the global protection system is something that can benefit refugees the world over and can help to better share out the responsibilities for refugees with those countries that accommodate the greater part of the refugee population
although several major carriers have gone bust and the situation in the sector continues to deteriorate due to rising fuel costs and slower economic growth there is definitely no reason for panic in my opinion
i call on all my fellow members from countries which have not done so to work to make this a reality
this could ensure that only biofuels whose cultivation meets required environmental standards count towards objectives in the directive
even before mrs andreassen made the headlines we on the committee had a hearing about the bookkeeping system and we had discussions about it with the commissions internal audit service and with the court of auditors
i think that one consensus that has clearly emerged is the need to strengthen our solidarity at this time when we have an enlarged europe
certainly the european union and india should enhance their dialogue on human rights and democracy bilaterally and internationally
we requested this statement because the public is under the impression an impression which the spanish government and its minister of agriculture have helped to create that a member states government exerted an influence or pressure on one or more members of the commission when these decisions were being taken
i would also like to say that from a social point of view in the lisbon treaty there is the charter of fundamental rights there is the european social model
this will be the aim of the action plan and there is no doubt that we will deal with this problem of victim protection by taking account of what has been said during the debate namely the need to try first of all to make people aware of the tragedy and the suffering of victims who are often the subject of silence if not contempt
unfortunately it will be a good many years before the chemicals policy comes into force
undoubtedly the promised longterm approach setting multiannual catch targets will be a major improvement and help to solve the problem of discards
this is serious especially for the many chemicals with little or no associated information requirement
congratulations on your report mrs pagano
this is creating problems for us
i also welcome the fact that a risk was taken in speeding up the process which i hope can now move forward just as happened with the pact or conciliation
as regards amendment no 2 which relates to recital l i would prefer it if the socialist group would eliminate certain terms that weaken the text
european educational services and programmes speeding up the networking of schools and teachers through european platforms and virtual classrooms these are some of the necessary responses in the exchange of good practice
reducing the burden on business simplifying the formalities particularly at the startup phase and setting up funds
the report proves conclusively and extensively in its introduction inter alia that a the probability of adults developing an addiction alcoholism increases significantly if they start drinking as children or adolescents b the useabuse of alcohol by children and adolescents is increasing continuously in all the countries of the u c many countries in the u produce alcopops ie refreshments containing alcohol which are freely sold to children and adolescents d there is a direct and worrying link between violence and antisocial behaviour and between road traffic accidents deaths disabilities and the use of alcohol by children and adolescents
the crisis is not only a financial but also an economic issue
to come back for a moment to the question of third countries if mrs lucas will allow me a certain number of countries have continued to take discriminatory measures against european products which go beyond the international standards currently in force and we are working on this matter together with a certain number of our trading partners
the member states have applied budgetary rigour as a consequence of the stability pact and that must continue in the future
while it is true that this compromise is not perfect i believe that if it had not been adopted the situation would have been more complicated
i also welcome the fact that president barroso has set up a group of commissioners on fundamental rights antidiscrimination and equal treatment to establish a comprehensive and coherent strategy for protecting human rights
we need to state very clearly that the eu calls on the us to give up this initiative and pledges itself and its member states not to take part in this project on any level
this is true for example of the eus position between israel and the palestinians
i have to get something off my chest with regard to the dutch translation of the word protection
no doubt you have had heated discussions in the commission
the barcelona process of which we will speak tomorrow and in the weeks and months to come will be a message that we too must connect with and bring reform bring employment and bring social capacity and economic capacity to the europe in which we believe
we know that president bush holds the reins of power and the way you minister roar is reminiscent of the way one of your predecessors klaus tpfer roared in 1992 when we were in much the same situation
we must see that the european citizens do not vote no because they understand what the european union is about
directive 9259eec on general product safety dgps was drawn up to that end
sixty percent of the european economy is taken up by services and we have a complete network of anticompetitive restrictions among the member states
the committee on the environment proposes that the addition of a reducing agent be extended to cover all cements containing more than two parts per million ppm of chromium vi with an exemption restricted to cases where the cement is used in closedcircuit fully automated systems
secondly we should contribute to the roadmaps monitoring process and put pressure on arab states to help dry up funds to extremist groups and to close the offices of those groups
given this impasse a simple and clear solution is required a solution that would instantly put an end to the terrorism israel must implement resolutions 242 and 338 withdraw from the occupied territories and withdraw its troops back to within its internationally recognised borders
in no way can this do anything to resolve the structural problems of society and the economy
there has been considerable progress on the trade and cooperation agenda where there have been very good and thorough discussions on both sides
nevertheless i think that the amendments succeed in improving the texts from the point of view that i just specified quality of products and correct consumer information
there is also another question which we shall have to take increasingly into account from now on and that is the question of risk and the burden of proof
the commission had proposed a tac of only 11 000 tonnes for 2001
competitiveness cohesion and solidarity must be advanced in parallel they must so to speak move forward in step with each other
who knows one day they might be the champions of fundamental rights and rule of law and may well adopt a leading role in the european union
if we pour a lot of money into the construction of the brenner tunnel that will only be a sound investment if a shift in the cost structure actually leads to the desired changes on the transalpine route
only then can the wise 3x20 objective be achieved
mr hudghton that is not a point of order that is a point of detail
the approaches have provided for the targeted breakdown and intimidation of the opposition by massive changes in election legislation the imprisonment and elimination of potential opponents such as khodorkovsky and the repeated arrests of garry kasparov
we must for example help switch highvolume longdistance freight away from the road onto the railways where it belongs
this is where we need to move ahead this is where we need approaches that are good for more than just today
of course the draft adopted by consensus represents common ground between different positions some of our representatives proposals met with substantial resistance echoes of which were heard in this chamber just now
ships carry over 70 of all trade between the community and the rest of the world
it therefore requires protection and regulation not only by states but also at international level
the precise arrangements for this have not yet been determined
on behalf of the pse group mr president first of all we want to call on the burmese regime to release political opponents and the more than 1 800 political prisoners including aung san suu kyi the leaders of the 88 generation students and the leaders of the shan nationalities league for democracy arrested in 2005 to account for all the casualties and missing persons from last septembers crackdown on protests by buddhist monks and democracy activists including the whereabouts of missing monks and nuns to secure access to burma for the incoming un special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in burma and to permit opposition political parties to meet with the special envoy
as a result we have a large number of relatively young pensioners who are under 55 years of age and of course it has to be said that this has reached its limit
we expect that this will facilitate the recruitment of staff from new member states in particular
we must reject this proposal
new trends in drug use especially polydrug use have emerged in recent years
a great number of comments have therefore been made the executive arm of the community should take these into account when it comes to spelling out specific measures
the portuguese presidency is waiting for the political commitment demonstrated by mercosur to take the form of an improved offer so that the commission might resume the negotiations with a view to the speedy conclusion of an agreement which is fair and balanced for both parties
someone once said that if it had been men who consistently fell foul of the pension systems the basic principles would have been fundamentally overhauled long ago
the next item is the report a500802001 by mr purvis on behalf of the committee on industry external trade research and energy on the future of the biotechnology industry 20002100ini
the next issue is to ensure that the different international humanitarian ngos will be given access without having to obtain clearance from either party in the conflict
we have been looking forward to it for a long time
the offices for standardisation have very limited national budgets in the new member states compared to germany france or the united kingdom and they must also carry the burden of translation costs
the total funds allocated for preparation for and prevention of terrorist attacks will amount to eur 21 420 000 next year
it is very important that we do this to underpin civil dialogue
the first example is a proposal for a directive the socalled bolkestein directive which in our opinion ought to be rejected
decommissioning costs were calculated on the basis of data from 2000 according to which the actual costs were expected to reach eur750million
therefore at the beginning of the year it looks as if the rals are substantial
the cumulative effect of these small improvements in these areas is to clarify the common position and to make it more precise and the noncommercialisation aspect has been greatly improved
it will define a methodology that can be used for the various means of transport
memorial sites for the victims of the crimes perpetrated by these totalitarian regimes whose impact was felt throughout europe have been included in the programme and are to receive funding both of which have the support of my group
the commission understands the concerns expressed by mr salafranca which moreover coincide with those expressed by some of the beneficiary countries
the debate is closed
i also deeply regret the unilateral decision taken by the president of the united states to leave this framework and start a war i support mr annan
de mr president i rise to speak further to rule 29 of the rules of procedure of this house according to which it is a fundamental requirement where a political parliamentary group is to be formed that those who are to be its members share a political affinity
the last point that i would make is that we should avoid using the article42
as far as my position and that of my group is concerned there has never been any conflict of principles or ideology against the idea of liberalisation which we all agree with and support while of course seeking to ensure the guarantees that are necessary for a universal service
with regard to the external aspect the european union like the wto should speak unanimously
there are some in the council who think that we are not being particularly generous in leaving it at a cut of 50
that is certainly true but do you really believe that this draft which represents the outcome of two years work on the liberalisation of the market in services within the european union is actually good
on behalf of the uen group pl mr president commissioner the committee on regional development has recently tabled a couple of important owninitiative reports
however i believe that there is justification for this because we will receive requests from the third countries that we work with
the revision and strengthening of article 69 would also be a way of providing effective financial support for weakened areas such as mountainous regions for restructuring sectors in difficulty such as stockbreeding and milk or for managing risks
i think that the capital of culture programme is as popular in the field of culture as erasmus is in the area of education
my group also welcomes belgiums proposal for a ministerial meeting on north korea
we emphasise the need for an expansionist policy coordinated jointly by the eu and its member states which will be aimed at strengthening internal demand public investment research and education highquality public services in areas such as health and housing including infrastructure and equipment which promotes high rates of employment with rights and which guarantees economic and social cohesion and balanced environmental development
es madam president the strengthening of relations between the european union and the united states is key in the transatlantic context and in an increasingly multipolar world
secondly procedural guarantees
companies are going bankrupt in the economic recession and airline companies are no exception
rather than revisit the debate which was a lively one i want to tell you that having recognised this morning yesterday evening and during the course of yesterday that this proposal would not gain a majority you came to the right conclusion by acceding to parliaments wishes
i should like to thank the commissioner and my fellow members mrs guyquint and mrs jensen for their words of appreciation to me as well as mr elles and mr grech for the positive way in which they carried out this budget procedure
presidentinoffice of the council

is the presidency sensitive to all aspects of the potential impact of the revision
we must stop lying to ourselves
while this is to be welcomed the fact remains that the illicit cigarette trade costs the eu as much as 95 billion in lost revenue each year and that this money goes to criminals and has been used to fund terrorist organisations such as the real ira
how mendacious then of people such as the representatives of the german building trade to demand or so we read that the transitional periods be extended
the accession of bulgaria and romania is beyond question
marketing of some pharmaceutical products made from seals such as dietary supplements will not be allowed
where biodiversity is concerned we are lagging even behind the united states in terms of legislation
we should continue along the present path of reinforcing the multifunctional aspects of our agricultural policy
similar arrangements can also be sought in a larger context not least with the us
and today we are watching as this island is caught in the grip of the same hellish spiral
i also wish to emphasise that this programme must genuinely enable us to create a european higher education system that is effective and recognised for the quality of its training and of the reception it provides
let us hope that this is a step in the direction of better relations in iraq and improved conditions of safety
finally i would like to ask the council their opinion on the uturn in the ppe position and the proposal to break the gentlemans agreement
we are thankful for small mercies following a downturn of the kind seen after first reading
when we speak of regional identity in the european union it goes without saying that we invoke culture
had the commissioner for development and cooperation given this speech fifteen or ten years ago the content would have been identical
we have not yet done this for good reason
his death is a loss to all of us
it would therefore be a very good thing for us to realise that the path to prosperity leads neither through chinesestyle wage levels nor through the sort of industrial relations that prevail in the united states
the families of the victims in iraq cannot forget this fact and the iraqi constitution does not permit the presence of groups such as the nko or the pkk on iraqi soil
why am i so concerned about this
mr president ladies and gentlemen i would like to begin by stressing the good work and wonderful cooperation of the rapporteur mrs ksné kovcs and i would like to congratulate her on her efforts and the report she has presented
you may be aware of the findings of a recent euro poll which showed that the european parliament is one of the most recognised of all eu institutions
the measures implemented and financed from this package should therefore help prevent a repeat of this crisis
the strong influential political europe of the future cannot however be created with an antiamerican stance
as yet the international monetary fund has been unable to confirm that in terms of control of expenditure it is doing all that we expect to be done as a matter of course when european funds are being used
the interim review is therefore key
the european council is expected to convene an igc later this year
for this reason also i hope that the meeting in rome will produce real results
at the moment the money is unfortunately not there
we also have to recognise the fact that privatisation normally means higher prices for water and purification services which naturally cause the greatest problems for the poorest people
in parallel we will present an action plan in two months time defining priority areas for action
member of the commission mr president i already used some of the arguments in my previous answer but it is clear that this is a very important area and i will try to highlight some other additional information in responding to this question
since that is the case it should come as no surprise that other countries of the european union with very significant industries and sectors in social and economic terms demand justice and the proper defence of their rights and will not make exceptions
that gives us a good example of what should be done
the reactions of consumer associations automobile associations spare parts manufacturers associations and independent repairers associations to the commissions draft regulation have been very positive
actions that i absolutely do support are moves to reduce to a minimum the permitted blood alcohol levels not just for young drivers but also for persons working in public transport
eliminating hunger is one of the most important challenges facing humanity and can only be achieved through concerted action by national governments and the international community
it was the only equitable and honourable outcome
it is worth noting that unlike iraq the quartet is an example of how a common european foreign and security policy based on unanimity can actually work
this is why i am presenting the text to you in this partsession
what about this 80
the sustainable development of transport can help to abate climate change
if we consider and that seems very much what you were advocating commissioner that water is a public good then we should ensure that the public authorities keep control of water distribution in each and every country
i think i have answered mr medina ortegas questions in connection with the european court of justice
this new law represents a uturn in united states policy by reintroducing a clear support for prices which could place community producers at a clear disadvantage
i do not want to see the continued stonewalling against all appeals to bring those responsible for this evil deed to justice
lastly i wish to highlight what appears to be an appropriate financial envelope for setting up courses degrees study grants partnerships lectures seminars and all the other actions that will make this initiative a reality
the payment appropriations should be adjusted in line with actual requirements and in particular we should draw lessons from the previous budget outturn so as to be able to determine our real ability to implement sectoral policies
mr president mountain regions are proclaiming themselves as areas of economic social and cultural life but they are seeking recognition firstly they are seeking recognition of their handicaps
it would be better if all the richer countries in the european union helped countries like bulgaria and romania to lower their emissions
lastly we have taken a slight departure from the norm and are recommending that the 220 council posts are not approved until we have received a satisfactory explanation on a number of points which are listed in our amendment
my colleague mrs evans addressed another important point namely the ethic that permeates the cartagena protocol and that is based on the requirement for countries that do not want to produce or consume gmos in any form to be entitled to refuse them
this is a proposal submitted by the commission in april this year
i would like to conclude by saying that i hope that your presidency will be conducted in a manner that reflects the tone of your first speech in other words determined and pleasant
the mitchell commission and i hope we will do much the same in my judgment supports those who are still committed to working for peace on both sides of the argument
approval of minutes of previous sitting see minutes
however i must draw a distinction between the act of procurement to which the notforprofit principle should apply and the secondary activities such as the further processing manipulation testing or the manufacturing of products to which it should not apply
the other problem is buildings policy
your speech once again made it clear that you as the vicepresident of the commission responsible for plan d are someone in whom we can trust and on whom we can rely
firstly the allegations about 61 released detainees having become involved in terrorism we have heard from lawyers who know about these things that this is largely baseless
the council asked us to abandon the route towards turning our assistants into officials
article 9 contains the basic principle that the board of an offeree company may only take defensive measures after prior consultation of the general meeting of shareholders
that is an overview of the forthcoming european council for which preparations are currently in full swing
for the record comments were properly made to me pointing out that there is insufficient ngo involvement in agenda preparation and presentation in the commissions twiceyearly meetings with brusselsbased development ngos
the next item is the joint debate on
they protect their stability and survival by means of total control over the flow of information
even if this summit had not achieved any other results these would be enough to demonstrate that cooperation between the two sides of the atlantic is a politically credible process as commissioner vitorino has said which will proceed at a good pace despite the difficulties being experienced by some latin american countries
after all in freemarket consumer societies the consumer is king
they have been referred back to us simply because there are some changes to the comitology procedure
madam president commissioner i should like to have practical proposals for measures
it is to be hoped that as many heads of state or government as possible will attend the meeting
parliaments budgetary authority is defined in article 272 of the ec treaty
i thank the honourable member for raising this question because it gives me an opportunity to emphasise the point that she made in her supplementary question
we in this house therefore have the opportunity i would even say the duty to make this europe more transparent more democratic easier to understand and hence more acceptable
these do not have very much to do with one another
it does not
wherever possible automatic stabilisers will have to operate fully but we must also continue to make progress on reducing deficits
this indicates the scale of the problem
it certainly should not be allowed to be hijacked by those extremists who will never recognise that peace in the middle east as elsewhere will only come by negotiation and not by the bullet and the bomb
in addition persecutions on political andor theological grounds continue to occur frequently
this includes the freedom to practise ones religion just as much as it includes a religions duty to show tolerance towards the other faiths which exist alongside it
parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment
that does not just cost money it leads to further dilution of concentration of accountability and that is extremely important
however we might well have a running battle on our hands if contrariwise we did not do everything in our power to fight drug use
laughter
today however there is no doubt about the european unions commitment to the fight against terrorism
i think it is worthwhile recalling a couple of significant ideas that have formed part of the aspirations of farsighted politicians over the centuries
in addition as mrs flautre mentioned we expect the burmese authorities to invite international monitors to oversee the referendum
on the other hand it provides among other things for the complete financing of the second part of the recovery plan
in this day and age the solutions are much more complicated and we must come up with a different approach
in fact at least that is what the commission proposes if disappointing developments were to be noted for example in this very political area in which you are now expressing concerns it should be possible to activate a socalled emergency break in the form of suspending further negotiations
how to realise the policies which will make europe what we always call when speaking of lisbon the most dynamic and competitive economy in the world
here too there are clear demands on everyone involved in this process
in this context i would once again like to emphasise how important it is that we adopt generally accepted european accident indicators as our yardstick
that is a good sign for the negotiations
indeed protected adults must be able to enjoy the same freedom of movement as other citizens regardless of the protection they receive
that is the problem
however with regard to the second issue that is the pluralism of beliefs as support for human rights in a society i am a great deal more sceptical
this in essence means that the increase in cost is actually borne by the fisher himself
under no circumstances does this report seek to minimise the risks associated with drugs and the harm they cause and in my opinion there are no grounds for specifically upsetting the balance in mrs buitenwegs report which it was difficult but right to obtain
it is evident that such provisions enable situations of scientific uncertainty to be dealt with an approach that the countries of the south do not have the resources to undertake as impartially as ourselves
there is no choice
the ecchina agreement on customs cooperation and mutual administrative assistance with china provides the legal basis for this cooperation
however as these questions come under the commissions jurisdiction the commission cannot agree to their being included in the basic council regulation
secondly it requires swift and effective compensation for the damage suffered
first of all i would like to express my appreciation to the delegation of parliament that took part in the conciliation meeting with the council on 31january
the house rose and observed a minutes silence
a report on the tragic situation in that region was adopted in march yet the council as a whole was unable to draw logical conclusions from that report and deal with the problem of the sudanese authorities political responsibility for the political situation in that country
my amendment to recommendation no 5 argues in favour of clarity as regards the origin of evidence due to the importance of this clarity for legal cases
what is at stake in your opinion
we will adjourn the sitting for five minutes as neither the rapporteur nor the speakers who need to take the floor on this item are present
to reflect this it is not enough simply to calculate funds for health and education where they appear as focal sectors
we need to make a timely start as regards working on the question of how to make the best use of the frequency spectrum dividend
just as the dci is deployed our parliament here must be given real influence and control in the same manner
you were thanked personally for facilitating that conference
the european parliament now calls upon the commission in my person to take further action in this field
while the report says much about the need for protection of privacy and monitoring of the secret services what should the individual do
i also want to highlight a major change that has taken place in the imo which up to now was practically immovable
protecting the traditional cultural identity of individual regions and the ability to find out about them thanks to mobility including in the field of cultural education is a further chance for creative development
how could our parliament aside from showing indignation not send a strong and symbolic message to promote that diversity and the tolerance required in a globalised world by forcefully condemning such remarks
democracy there cannot function as it should under such conditions
as mr dalema said the iraq war has been a tragic mistake and we cannot make history anew but and i say this to mr tannock there is a point at which we must be able to recognise our own mistakes if we are to be able to rectify them
full broadband facilities must be available to all rural as well as urban areas and especially to the most peripheral areas of the european union
as the british would say the proof of the pudding is in the eating and i think that this plan will only be a success if we meet all the conditions
as i have said that is the policy of france and i hope that if some day europe manages to have some kind of influence over the events in that poor world it will realise that it is the wisest path to take
if that is 1 or 115 so be it as long as it is done according to the capacity and the means of each country
it is also a scientific fact that far more people die from being too cold than from being too warm
according to the lisbon strategy however competitiveness cannot come about if the member states do not start to implement decisions effectively
it is clear that the election results did not reflect the will of the people of zimbabwe
mr president mrs stihler will also be aware that the councils options and powers are of course limited but there are fortunately other channels and other bodies that can deal with situations of this kind subject to these limitations the council is of course always alert and she will also be aware of the ways in which it can exert influence and become involved should information come to its attention
this is regrettable to my mind
my liberal socialist and green colleagues have worked very closely together on this report
in particular the headquarters agreement with spain has been signed
look at amendment 2 for example
the member states can no longer bear the burden of environmental pollution alone and they should not be required to do so for much longer
therefore i welcome the fact that ratification is being continued
the seminar is a further initiative
madam president i congratulate all our rapporteurs in undertaking this gargantuan effort today and shall focus briefly on two points council transparency and mr doorns report on subsidiarity
we welcome dialogue certainly constructive dialogue but not only do we need to listen to each other we must also try to understand one another particularly if we do not share the same views
ro reducing the financial programming period to five years as also recommended in the bge report and i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate mr bge for his particular contribution to this report would provide concrete proof of the european institutions maturity and an indication of cutting red tape
thus foodquality schemes do not only provide consumers authentic products but can also support rural development
with regard to your recommendation on inkind contribution let me say that while article 56 of the general regulation on the european regional development fund the european social fund and the cohesion fund already allows for inkind contribution to eu cofinanced projects the real challenge is the use of this provision
first of all and certainly not in contravention of the report we should like to emphasise the institutional reforms that are necessary
firstly in the political field there have clearly been significant results such as the firm commitment to fight terrorism and drug trafficking which threaten the whole world and to this end to strengthen the mechanisms for cooperation between governments
mr president i welcome all these reports but will concentrate this morning on the bsch report highlighting the very important work carried out by the ombudsman which goes some way to respecting the idea of transparency and open governance
at the end of the day i hope meps are the first port of call for citizens who have problems
so the time has come for you mr president to take disciplinary measures against everyone who was in the vicinity on behalf of the security service and failed to intervene
these tests showed that the highest level of chemicals was found not in the grandmother who had lived through the highest levels of pollution in our streets in the 1930s 1940s and 1950s but in the granddaughter who was 15 years old
all layers of iraqi society were represented including many women
if we permit the trade in what is part of the human body ie blood we have to remember that the less developed countries will follow europe s example

commissioner almunia made a very important point about the 3 which nobody wants to abandon nor should anyone give up the 60 but the crucial point is that if we retain this guideline and our group too knows that it is indispensable then the commissioners statement to this house to the effect that because conditions differ from one country to another no one objective can be imposed and that each country must be enabled within its own specific limits to overcome its difficulties in order to get back on track for the goals when it has problems is also a step in the right direction for those who want to save the pact are thereby put in a position to be able to do so
the issue before us is the extension of the fisheries protocol between the eu and cape verde for the period 1 july 2004 to 30 june 2005 which focuses mainly on tuna and which is intended to enable community tuna shipowners to continue to pursue their fisheries activities in the exclusive economic zone of cape verde

the europe that we want and mr schulz the french presidency will make proposals on this subject proposals for regulations to raise the moral standards of financial capitalism because we can see now that the reasons that global growth has halted for a year is because of the subprime crisis and the crisis of confidence in the financial institutions which have done whatever they like whenever they like lending money to anyone under any conditions
the most serious of these include human rights violations arrests kidnappings torture intimidation and the expulsion of journalists

i do not need to answer specific points because i covered them at the start

in this debate we shall examine
we need a proposal for a regulatory instrument in the course of 2008 we need to discuss it and we need to conduct this debate now not in twenty years time because we have had to wait until everyone has been convinced by governments of countries which are in many cases far less seriously affected by the problem than those in the central part of the european union
what is required and will continue to be required most of all is that the consumers be protected and kept informed since it is they who in cases of doubt will be harmed whilst the manufacturers will make a profit

it is important that we try to establish the necessary resources and mobilise them to ensure that this does not happen and try to avoid drawing political advantage from these situations
secondly it draws conclusions which cannot be fully substantiated such as that it is not used for military purposes
a few decades back there were even bomb attacks here in the community in the south tyrol which is nowadays a peaceful model region of europe of which we can be proud
on the issue of judicial training the council shares parliaments opinion that there is a need to foster a genuine eu judicial culture by inter alia promoting direct exchanges between judges prosecutors and members of the judicial staff of different member states and to actively develop the european judicial training network
in this regard what i would like to ask is whether you believe that independently of all these issues approved at european councils we should not take humanitarian measures appropriate to the everyday reality taking place on our coasts and other places which are not coastal where there are immigrants living in bad conditions who require suitable humanitarian assistance
we have to build this europe in a spirit of true partnership
we will see this once again in a few days time at the world social forum in porto alegre

and that reaction must also and above all come from this european parliament
if we compare these general principles these solemn declarations with social reality with the everyday world we live in specifically in terms of the achievement of womens equality in the field of representation amongst the european unions social partners one conclusion immediately springs to mind there is still much to do
the council has included in the budget the whole of category 2 of the financial perspectives which is dedicated to structural measures as commitment appropriations in line with the conclusions reached by the european council of berlin in march 1999
we in the european union should also confront this problem
we condemn the position of the group of the european peoples party christian democrats and european democrats including new democracy which voted almost in its entirety against the amendments as well as the stand taken by the socialist group including pasok which while voting in favour of the amendment which accepted the principle of the use of space solely for peaceful purposes at the same time voted against an identical amendment opposing the use of space for military activities

on behalf of the alde group mr president the imminence of the accession of romania and bulgaria is underlined by todays vote on the nominees for the posts of two commissioners and two members of the court of auditors

mr president i would like ask the minister if he is happy that whereas there is sufficient and advanced testing for driving with alcohol the same advanced testing is not there for driving with illegal drugs
i have several important points to make on my report concerning the marco polo programme
in fact in some ways it is a matter of setting things straight covering the risk and counteracting the hesitancy of companies when it comes to investing in research and innovation which is perhaps also an evil of the european corporate mindset
israel continues to violate international law with complete impunity
some very short points the amount of waste which is now being collected from the streets is well below the amount being put on the streets the measures that the government is taking are therefore completely inadequate
my report therefore has as its main objective the simplification and harmonisation of the rules relating to these variations of marketing authorisations for medicinal products
on behalf of the guengl group de mr president the eu has deployed a eufor mission in chad and one eufor peacekeeper has already been killed
if this is the case my group can withdraw the request for a split vote
at the same time the eu must ensure that the principle of conditional access to the market is upheld by recommending that the wto adopts stricter protection standards for quality products so that imported products can be subject to the same safety and quality requirements as european products
however i would like to make one point
it would be worth extending standard campaigns to include alcopops alcoholic beverages frequently consumed by young people which are generally considered to be fairly harmless or even as not containing alcohol
this change to the agenda would allow mrs beckett the minister responsible for this issue to be present in the house
this years conference of the parties will be particularly important for an assessment of the situation
despite a compromise the european parliament and the council are still far apart
the original system for administering changes appears ineffective and unsatisfactory in view of new scientific knowledge and technological progress

both energy and broadband internet are important sectors but we cannot be sure that they are the top priority sectors and more importantly the sectors that will generate the additional jobs and growth that we need
the earmarking takes account of the needs of both more and less advanced regions in europe because there have been references to unfair cohesion policy and we say that all three dimensions of cohesion must be taken seriously
as far as the correlation between the irish referendum on the lisbon treaty and the ccctb is concerned i want to emphasise that the commission is taking a measured approach based on wide consultation and detailed study of all aspects of the ccctb
a uachtarin ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le rialtas na héireann le rialtas na breataine agus leis an rialtas nua i mbéal feirste
here in the european parliament today we are celebrating one of the most important and historic decisions that the european union has taken so far
our fellow member has to be precise tabled a motion of inadmissibility based on the absence of a legal basis pending the ratification of the treaty of nice
it should remain this way
even outside europe i believe we have to keep a watchful eye on this
the green paper will furthermore arrive too late to contribute to the discussion in the convention about the role of services of general interest
the preservation of this heritage means the preservation of the memories of our culture and history everyday life big events small tragedies and common joys
a precondition for obtaining the support of our citizens is that our environmental work is transparent
this is why we are asking for the management tools to be developed further to help us to find out more about the way in which the budget is implemented and to include more of the implementation process in the planning procedure
admittedly the normal budgetary procedure for the europe of fifteen in which parliament has the right of codecision was not followed
that unfortunately has not always been the case
the main responsibility for this drama lies with the taliban regime which is systematically destroying its own country and killing the spirit of its own population so that migrations of people have become a necessary evil
we wish to strengthen the un system and we believe that this is the prerequisite for success in that rebuilding of iraq that we all wish to see
in fact i only agree with some of the points considered and therefore i cannot fully endorse the text in question
we also agreed that a rulebased system remains the best guarantee for ensuring that commitments are enforced for all member states in an equal way
our government in particular seems well capable of making its own mess of our transport policy without any help from the commission and its jargon
i believe that mrs ferrerowaldner could take the necessary steps
each of the suspects was capable of firing the weapon but all the evidence suggests that only one of them actually acted in a criminal manner
european and un responsibility should be fully engaged in supporting the process of reconstruction which is currently being taken forward by the coalition forces in iraq and the courageous men and women who are taking it forward on our behalf
second surely the national interest of the superpower is to put its traditional allies on the spot not challenging their right to consultation but probing what they have to say and how they intend to turn their rhetoric about cooperation into effective not effete multilateralism
there is a need for greater communication and understanding not only of what europe does but also of the responsibility of its citizens to ensure we are as good as we can be
whereas the repressive measures against migrants and asylum seekers encounter no opposition any measure designed to increase the attractiveness of the eu to the most highly skilled workers so as to meet the needs of the eu labour market in order to ensure europes prosperity as well as to respect the lisbon targets are to be supported
you criticise rightly the way the european central bank has been managing the euro from its ivory tower but you never recommend reexamining the statutes which grant it all those powers and even assign it this task
today we are faced with a crisis but history has a sense of timing this challenge may be a deciding moment for europe but it has come while the convention is sitting
this is the impact assessment which was mentioned in the question
how can one speak of a social model that consigns so many to the misery of joblessness
plans cannot be established by law behind citizens backs and without taking into account their opinions the opinion of social agents and of the scientific community the territories affected through development considerations which focus more on concrete than on where to get water from and actually assessing who needs it and why
this is very heavy on those businesses so we should try to bring the roaming prices down to the real costs
it would take twenty years to finish them
as you know i recently presented a communication on governance which was fairly well received by our member states and which was well received too within the context of the meeting of the world bank in singapore in which we explained what made europe different
allocating hundreds of billions of euro to combating climate change amounts to an attack on human civilisation and common sense
on the other hand the convention members not least the president of this parliament the vicepresidents and myself will remain available to anyone and that includes those within this hemicycle who wishes to ask us about the arguments that have led us to put forward any particular proposal contained in the constitution
madam president can i remind you that this would not have happened to mr schulz
the skyeurope company was also one the most important clients for pragueruzyn the czech republics largest airport
let us grasp the opportunities that have been given to romania and bulgaria today but most importantly of all let us grasp the opportunities which have been given to the european union to act as a beacon of hope of democracy of freedom of respect for human rights across the world
i therefore think that this should have been recorded as a point of order while the point that i was making should be recorded in the minutes
delivery is fundamental
commissioner ladies and gentlemen first of all i want to thank mrs cederschild and mr cappato for the sound work they have done
de mr president i would like to add my congratulations to our rapporteur
it is to be welcomed that at the same time the discriminatory and inhuman treatment of women in afghanistan is receiving the attention it has long deserved there should be worldwide protest against this too
unilateral establishment of financial perspectives is incompatible with this even if it were understandable in the light of the situation on conclusion of the accession negotiations
as we heard yesterday a lack of council transparency remains the elephant in the room it remains the root cause of so much discontent with eu lawmaking in general
he was wondering about our constituent power
in each country of the eu then we need due care for the family which while being a tiny community is at the same time the cornerstone of the whole european community
of course mr corbett provided that the speakers in question are here because a president cannot give the floor to absent members
i welcome the fact that the european council reaffirmed the common objective to welcome bulgaria and romania in january 2007 as members of the union if they comply with all the conditions that were clearly set
the common agricultural policy and quotas have created a huge eur 25 billion trade deficit in the european union jobs are being lost and unemployment is rising
mrpresident there can be no doubt that the elections and the referendum in belarus were conducted in an undemocratic manner that they were not free and that they were not honest
we must send out a signal to the palestinians to give them hope of justice and to enable them to prevent the growth of fundamentalism we must send out a signal to the israeli government so that it knows that it cannot always act outside the law playing on the threat of antisemitism and terrorism
the european union has affirmed on a number of occasions the need to ensure that the security of the israeli and palestinian people both collectively and individually is always protected
it is not difficult to recognise then that the main reason why we cannot yet claim a 100 success rate in the fight against drugs along the lines set by these three conventions is that this fight is still not really being conducted in a truly international framework
we should not take sides
the removal of the reference to the country of origin principle and the adjustment to the actual application of the directive are the most symbolic setbacks imposed on the hardliners of liberal europe
this is a clear infringement of the ec treaty and parliaments competence
it should see it as an opportunity to bring our agenda closer to that of the citizens
my question to the rapporteur mrs buitenweg concerns the way in which she imagines dutch policy to protect childrens rights and to strengthen the position of dutch parents in telling their children both younger and older to resist drugs including cannabis
i think that at the moment this formula of compromise between parliament the council and the commission could help to solve the problems without us having to resort to the urgent procedure that the commission originally proposed
it is therefore important that the commission establish a strategy and set priorities bearing in mind the development of community policy concerning external relations in the area of judicial cooperation on civil and commercial matters
this european ejustice portal is therefore to come into operation by the end of december 2009 without fail
you said and i was so happy to hear you say it we need better regulation of the financial markets
this of course has created employment and in some cases has improved regional economy
we wholeheartedly support items 4653 of the report which are all designed to underline the high costs of the european parliaments travelling circus as it moves between brussels luxembourg and strasbourg

the issue that was in fact very much the driving force behind the work of the committee on economic and monetary affairs was a certain anxiety with regard to the circumstances in which the debate was conducted in the council
genetic engineering is a groundbreaking discipline and strikes me as very useful
the commission has particular difficulties determining the negative priorities to wit the activities that are unnecessary or less important and which should be abandoned
it is therefore essential to support the efforts made in the council of the european union by those governments radically opposed to amendment of the relevant provisions and deletion of the principle of supporting the lessdeveloped countries
that is why the question of additional measures is not being raised at least not for the moment the question being the need to apply existing measures correctly
that is what i take from this debate anyway and i have always been convinced of it
this is a good sign
the european union also respects the status of philosophical and nonconfessional organisations
is the commission satisfied looking deep into its heart for the truth that these numbers are known to anything more than a tiny minority of the public
that has now being reversed by the council of ministers
report a502782001 by mrs kinnock on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development on basic education in developing countries in the context of the united nations general assembly special session on children in september 2001 20012030ini

the commission can accept amendments 1 2 3 18 25 and 47 with redrafting
as you can see it is quite intense
the united kingdom should not become a member of eurojust and should retain its own strong resistance to terrorism
we owe you our respect and gratitude for promoting this process
the fourth is that bad european leadership is at its most prominent in external policy with major decisions but no funding

i should like to quote another example where european unity should be in evidence the imperative need to introduce common minimum social standards at european level

nothing could be more laudable for the group of the european peoples party than the defence of freedom and consumers
up to now i have not heard the commissioner say that he would not follow parliaments wish on this point
only when the iranian regime earns its legitimacy from its citizens can it be a credible player in the international community

the green paper will allow the commission firstly to examine whether a framework directive would be appropriate and secondly to launch a largescale debate on the overall issue
subsidies have not delivered prosperity and security for british farmers in fact often subsidies and quotas are being capitalised into the high cost base of our industry
it is impossible to understand why the commission has been putting off taking the immediate action that is required
for this reason i would like to congratulate our colleague mr vakalis for the way in which he managed to be a captain on this ship
i do not at present see that in the position of the net contributing countries and in the obsession with 1
we can do it in the first place by carrying out an actual impact assessment and that is what is still lacking at the moment
the debate also has the purpose of publicly and legitimately calling into question the need in an advanced country of 58 million inhabitants where the mafia controls eur 120 billion and a huge turnover and whole areas of the territory where refuse is killing off one of the richest provinces in the history of europe to declare a state of emergency appropriate to a tsunami or an earthquake for 12 months on account of the presence of 160 000 travellers half of whom are italian citizens
those people who are blind or visually impaired on the other hand will not benefit
romania needs to continue its efforts and demonstrate further results in the fight against corruption notably in terms of further investigations and subsequent judicial proceedings
mr president our citizens expect us to provide real help for them in these troubled times

in ireland we have our own problems with media ownership that we must regulate
scotland has miles and miles of splendid beaches
madam president allow me to explain my vote on the swoboda report
as for national policies instead of becoming more flexible they are more and more restrictive
nevertheless it is important for the member states to sign the memorandum of understanding

however we reject the idea that provisions for future expenditure such as retirement pensions should be included among debts from now on for we need to bear in mind that apart from the ageing process the disruption of the climate is the most significant debt bequeathed to future generations
mr president ladies and gentlemen first of all i believe i said although perhaps in rather diplomatic terms that the council cannot comment on the way in which a member country a member state organises the maintenance of public order on its own territory because it does not have the authority to do so
parliament is concerned about the way nonstate actors and international organisations are using european union funds
the alternative would have been to create a mammoth overbureaucratised structure in its directorate general all the more so of course with the prospect of enlargement
here we have finished the first reading but there is an unjustified delay in the council
mr president commissioner i would also like to congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work and the commissioner for her tenacious efforts in this field

mr president as this debate comes to an end i would like to thank all the rapporteurs mr bsch mr perry mrs almeida garrett mrs sbarbati mr camisn asensio and all the members who are committed to the institution of petitions i also would like to thank the european ombudsman who carries on the fight in defence of the citizens from his observation post
we need you to stick to your brief
european governments should not now view these criteria as a scourge or obstacle to their development therefore but as a sustainable path to a healthy economy
unfortunately a great many of our fellow members still do not know this
is it because there is historically a general degree of naivety as regards this substance
i wish to express my support for the decisions adopted at the recent european union summit held in brussels
for that reason apart from any other i am pleased with this report and i hope that it is supported in the house tomorrow
i wonder whether that means that the uk independence party is now transferring in its entirety or at least the two members who are present here to the other group
certainly the members of the petitions committee in my group have told me that they are happy with that compromise and i think it is a workable compromise
i believe that we have come here today with a coherent approach
the nut sector is of great social and environmental importance to the european union and to the southern countries such as spain italy greece portugal and france because these countries have many small farms that create a great number of jobs and which also have a considerable and direct influence on the environment
i have had the honour of being its vicepresident for 12 of them
that is how credible the ministers and leaders of iran are
in the years ahead we should invest more in the belarussian people in this way
i would like to respond briefly to a number of specific questions which have been asked
only the member states will have the legitimate instruments needed for any farreaching action and they will have to remove the shackles of the eu and the euro if such action is to be achieved
most importantly however all of this must not be taken as an opportunity for more liberalisation and further concentration in the area of energy and the further domination of the most powerful countries
so let me thank you for all your contributions
only if there is real change in policy will europe be able to face the great challenges in an effective way
competitiveness is not just about individuals being able to make the largest profits possible but about making our national economies so strong that they can achieve the great social goals such as high standards of environmental protection and social security
when we discussed mrs lucas report we then stated that competition was one of the key points
the report is clearly supranational in character
we also propose that the simplification dossiers be put near the top of our agendas and that the council and parliament should endeavour where possible to adopt simplification dossiers at first reading
each shipowner continues to have the right to decide and no individual or member state is being ordered or forced to scrap
both were obsessed with their own narrow vision of the unification of their continents
the second concern is the one expressed by mrs stihler namely that with this revision of the regulation there could be unreasonable exploitation of fish stocks in particular the fish stocks of third countries
in that context however the commissions responsibility is to preserve any right it might have to ensure that all actions carried out to reduce emissions of fgases are compatible with the treaty
mr president ladies and gentlemen after 10 years the growing space carved out by the euro in international trade and its use as a reserve currency show that it has become a world benchmark

b505532001 by mr martinez and others on behalf of the tdi group on footandmouth disease
there is a democratic deficit in the eu because the evercloser union was designed as irrevocable
this is why the programme is of key importance
so here too we must find a new approach and make the sector our first and most important policy adviser
that is where much improvement can take place
it is not my intention to lay the blame on any particular nation
firstly because the union will be enlarging to encompass the entire european family and secondly because the union is laying down its constitutional rules following the work of the convention on the future of europe and in the context of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference
your fellow countryman a thinker resting in the pantheon rousseau wrote that any law that the people have not ratified in person is void it is not a law at all
my group has emphasised that there is no sector that can survive these conditions and that is why it wanted to bring everyone together today including the council and the commission to find out more about this issue and debate the package of measures
otherwise we will be unable to integrate the roma community into european society and bring it into the european order
these reports should be used to justify requests for additional funds so that parliament might arrive at a more rational decision about fund allocation
i think that we are laying a huge mine under the very efforts by iranian students with whom i think most members sympathise with the pretexts we are giving the conservative regime to crush their rebellion
it is not only members of my own group that have raised such concerns and they are entirely legitimate given that worrying examples of money being wasted in this way can be found in the daytoday practices of the different member states
i speak here as someone who was chief executive of the national building agency in the united kingdom
if the regulation under discussion helps to bring this about we shall be able to count it as one of our successes
it is the moment when the two colegislators the council and parliament add their political seal to the new legislation
progress report on croatia debate
we already know about the initiatives by senators john mackein and john kerry in this direction
there may be lots of theories and such speculation but the truth is we do not have the answer and we need that and to be given the extra support
i understand the commissioner does not wish to take the floor so the debate is closed
the first of course is jobs
a number of states want to join our union
it will also be used to fund projects aimed at mobilising public opinion against all forms of terrorism
it pays for regional projects that would otherwise not have been considered worthwhile
mr liese has already said that we are dealing with other issues besides economic matters and as a parliament we shall be following all these actions closely
mr president i should like to congratulate mr coelho the chairman and the honourable members of this parliament who participated in the work of the temporary committee on echelon especially the rapporteur mr schmid for the comprehensive and wellwritten report on the echelon interception system

are we credible
the european social fund esf as one of the eus structural funds was set up to reduce differences in prosperity and living standards across eu member states and regions with the aim of promoting employment as well as economic and social cohesion
i think the paramount concern here was saving the faces of president barroso and the commission
this is policy both in europe and in the national member states
i believe it is important to ensure that consumers have genuine choice and it is necessary to guarantee pluralism of content in a very concentrated market where those chiefly responsible for innovation and creativity are small not big
here we should add that gdp growth in the united states stood at 35 in 2005 and was therefore more than twice as high as in the european union
the first of the three inquiries that have now been launched in the uk will need to look at that and perhaps also at the role of one form of cap subsidy in encouraging some of these forms of animal movement
vicepresident of the commission fr mr president ladies and gentlemen i am very pleased to be able to take my turn in congratulating the authors of these three reports and i would say to mrs dati that really these reports are perfectly in keeping with the efforts which have been made by the french presidency and to which we have obviously given full consideration
it is also proposed that there be a ban on fishing eel during the first 15 days of the month which is excessive and would have a major socioeconomic impact
as long as we cannot be sure that in some countries people who are suspected or accused of having committed certain types of offences enjoy procedural guarantees similar to those that exist in other countries it will be difficult to gain broad acceptance for the principle of mutual recognition
that is to be welcomed
funding the measures proposed for combating animal diseases or funding this package which still needs to be tidied up
the commission has therefore made a statement which is to be published in the official journal together with the directive in which it points out that such delays should be considered exceptional and should remain so in order to maintain the effectiveness of community action within the internal market
although not all extractive industries have the same environmental and safety impact if the committee on the environment succeeds then this legislation will make them all needlessly subject to the same restraint
they manage to earn money but a great deal less than the residents of the preenlargement eu as it was before may2004
i am sure that as the hearings progress i will find out more about what is meant by that but i have to say that i think it rather insubstantial
pl mr president according to the resolutions passed by the european union most member states concentrate their aid activities on subsaharan africa which also includes the states of west africa
de mr president i should like at this point to remind the house of an issue raised at the world climate conference in poznn because the commitment with which a technology that does not even work yet is being canvassed seems absurd to me
it would appear that workers in the countries of the european union and i am speaking of greece in particular are indeed considered to be expendable resources and their health and their lives are being sacrificed by big business to the quest for maximum profit
the first difference is that they can be perpetrated from a distance
on behalf of the ppede group de mr president when we drafted the resolution we used the previous text the wording of which does not entirely convey that the european council has met in the meantime
i do not want to go into details on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market
proactive thinking on human rights is regrettably selective in the eu
all of us have a duty to protect and inform the rights of consumers and get them the very best deal possible
i know that some of my fellow members dispute this
at the moment there are discussions between the european union and the ukraine with a view to closer collaboration these discussions are moving along smoothly
mr president the violence in indonesia is unremitting

the commission has continued its work on incorporating sustainability considerations in setting the mediumterm budgetary objectives
in fact that is a great priority for this commission
the commission welcomes the support given by parliament to the approach it adopted in its 2007 communication entitled a europe of results applying community law
at that time this had been the biggest international agreement between the community and any third country
i am pleased to say that the committee on employment and social affairs has taken on board the majority of the comments made by the committee on women s rights and equal opportunities
i just want to list a few points which will be important to us
in my opinion we should not set ourselves ambitious goals if we subsequently fail to secure the necessary funding for them
el mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the report by our fellow member mrs harkin on volunteering is a way for the european parliament to demonstrate its social aspect to european citizens
in addition if we add up the population groups of the three countries this makes a clear majority
at the same time i have a comment regarding the vote on paragraph 66
i hear that you are in the process of consulting the interested parties
i must say that the spring summit delivered more than i had anticipated
consequently i would like to thank all the experts and professionals from the industry as well as web user and consumer associations and finally my colleagues in the committee on culture for all the discussions we have been able to hold on these crucial issues
that does not detract from the fact that i expect the eu to translate all those words into action
admittedly this compromise is less ambitious than the one to which i aspired in taking a stand at first reading in favour of the compulsory substitution of extremely worrying chemical substances where safer alternatives exist
the renewable and alternative sources of energy we advocate are expensive
we should acting as the european union demand that those responsible be punished and that the peace process be reinstated
must it always be the taxpayer by way of the public purse who is asked to pay up when things get really expensive
this is a question of social policy for which the member states are responsible but it is also a question of social responsibility an issue of concern to the european parliament and for which the social partners are responsible

el un resolution 56168 lays down equal opportunities in order to provide a binding framework for the protection and dignity of the disabled

however all the other countries in europe also have the right to proceed along the road to a more democratic more transparent europe that is more capable of taking action
we make laws at european union level because the member states have agreed that certain measures should be determined at community level
maintaining good relations with the european union while supporting hizbollah is not an option
passing laws keeps us in business but enforcing laws actually delivers for our people and a failure to enforce laws frankly makes us look like fools
that is what we are doing
on behalf of the guengl group fi mr president minister lehtomäki commissioner as the finnish presidency ends the baton will be passed at the summit this week to germany
the only amendment that offers an opportunity for a fairer split in subsidies is amendment 19 tabled by the union for europe of the nations group which is in line with the european commissions proposal
the citizens perhaps do not understand sometimes why we sit for so long and why everything takes so long
we did it so that we could better understand what the integration of the two markets means not that we want to integrate them but that they are in fact already integrated
however overfishing means that before long there will be no fish left to catch
you were talking about a crisis of confidence
i think the debate was very important and constructive just with regard to the merits of the issues
this is what a number of countries including tanzania are doing
our cap and the associated budgets offset the social and environmental restrictions we impose on our farmers and aim to provide them with a comparable quality of life to that of the rest of the unions population
it is a disgrace that huge trade union organisations in europe with hundreds of thousands of members do not even have token representation of both sexes and that there are entire trade union executives made up only of men
unfortunately in some cases canals and rivers have been abandoned
they are alien to our tradition
the proposal also makes major technical improvements for example notifications crossborder mergers and the grouping of funds via masterfeederstructures
the member states the social partners and other parties involved must commit to implementing the political initiatives set out in the social agenda and the guidelines on employment
because of this the eu should also support citizens by securing them a strong position
the circumstances demand it
we have the opportunity to draw up a sustainable innovative and model plan
it is quite right that honduras has put bananas on the agenda for the hong kong ministerial conference
it was after all not least because of something of that sort that the draft constitution failed and was rejected
in the article in question the commission was called on to establish specific nutrient profiles which food must respect in order to bear nutrition or health claims
therefore and because it is important commissioner i want to call on you on behalf of all my fellow members not to upset the balance and for the promised legislation to be put in place soon

we are convinced that however much the imperialists try to justify their crimes in yugoslavia by distorting the truth they will not succeed
once again mr president ladies and gentlemen we have to draw a distinction between my replies as presidentinoffice of the council which cannot go beyond the presidency s remit as you must realise and the replies i might wish to give as a member of the belgian government
as a rule of thumb we can assume that the smaller the enterprise the heavier the relative burden of administrative costs
let us look at the broader picture
between 5 and 7 of the european citizens live in mountain regions on average there are few inhabitants who are therefore unable to form a strong lobby in terms of either numbers or wealth
changing existing regulations and ingrained procedures is not always popular
i would also however like to pay tribute to the actions of your predecessors mr president the actions of my predecessors karl von wogau who is still with us and of christa randzioplath who is also with us today
our job is to intervene
such applications remain highly controversial with no consistent opinion amongst the member states as to either their ethical legitimacy or their safety
we would have preferred the common position text which allowed no derogations
only public discussion can tease out those values that are common to all of us
the complexity of national administrations the limited facility for transposition and often the lack of will exacerbate things
we too are dismayed by the latest measures announced by the italian government to solve the roma problem in italy
lastly i wish to draw attention to the need for crucial measures to be adopted on the way in which the commission deals with companies with which it has contractual relations
in this direction it does not seem to make sense to use averages in order to ascertain the breadth of coverage of the workforce by the funds in question or the capitalisation of these funds and their accumulated reserves as a percentage of gdp or per insured
for the milk and the yoghurt or for the bottle and the tub
that is the sort of thing we must guard against
we must welcome as an extremely positive result the agreement on energy projects and broadband internet
the debate is closed
chinas contribution to the international fight against terrorism appears so far unfortunately to have been confined to beijings branding opposition dissidents and various minorities as terrorists and in that way obtaining an excuse for oppressing them
that is a matter on which i agree with him in spite of the fact that our political starting points are otherwise very different
the council which never makes statements on the basis of press stories has not received any official information about the events referred to by the honourable member in his question
in those two years the debate has continued to rage and culminated in the commission proposals which were discussed during the last ecofin council in scheveningen
while we have a proposal that is largely unproblematic i would like to comment on the issue of sanctions
these are hugely destabilising factors that will literally destroy the prospects of many countries if they are not effectively remedied
but equally legitimate is the right to have a referendum and that should always be protected
we cannot choose to increase the room for manoeuvre in the two simultaneously in an uncontrolled manner
not in the first instance in court where the average cost for a crossborder case is eur 2 500 and it takes between 23 and 29 months to resolve
we intend to do so this year as well and we would ask the commission to take note for once next year that parliament is setting these priorities and that this should be reflected in the draft budget
tuesday
i know it is very late and we are testing your patience
when the euro has risen against the dollar we have also heard comments from some manufacturers who for the most part produce in the euro area but sell outside this area
women are still the worst affected with average salaries still being considerably lower than those of men and women still experience considerable difficulty in being promoted to more senior and executive positions
amongst these instruments i would highlight the directives on minimum standards for the reception of asylumseekers in member states the directive on refugee status the dublin ii regulation and the directive on reuniting families
i hope that the commission will read the report by the conseil danalyse economique a highpowered economic committee of the french government chaired by prime minister dominique de villepin
mr president for two years the socalled international criminal tribunal for yugoslavia has been trying to find support for accusations against slobodan milosevic
that is why we will now have to analyse what we have received as input with these 150 contributions
i do not share that approach as i believe that the internal market laws should be the responsibility of commission officials as part of the discipline of effective policymaking
as we all know however there is a small provision in the treaty article 192 which grants parliament the right to ask the commission to draw up a proposal for legislation
our colleague has settled in over this period
secondly europes credibility we have called on the us to close guantnamo now we have to help to make that true
in fact within a few years the sector will want more goods to be transferred to other modalities in order to maintain mobility and cut down on traffic delays
what is more the eus fishing fleet is partly responsible for depleting fish stocks something pointed out by both swedish authorities and environmental organisations
if we compare the ombudsmans reports for 2004 and 2005 we see that the result was positive so that we can concentrate on the points in which the committee on petitions is particularly interested
i would just like to remind mr wurtz that mr milosevic was the force behind his political family
that is why it is also only fair that meps be given higher remuneration so that we can appoint staff and equally to the point do so under reasonable working conditions
as a matter of fact i find the adopted definition of politically exposed persons surprisingly loose
after all these rules stop privileges from being granted to products that are being exported from the areas of the settlements of israel in the gaza strip and on the west bank
that cannot be
if your work programme says nothing about controlling the europeans money what will happen in the end
the real europe is characterised by pluralism tolerance and balance and by a consensus designed to benefit our people
the same thing is happening with the restructuring and relocation of undertakings specifically of multinationals in a flagrant breach of respect for workers rights
i would say that perhaps around threequarters of these processes and threequarters of the appropriations recovered fall under this regulation
time and again it has been accompanied by a dynamism that has given the enlarged europe a greater capacity to make its mark in the world
yes europe can be close to its citizens as it is proving today
however the impact on those member states that are affected will clearly depend on the level of their current national rates
the un conference is therefore more overdue than premature
your vote will send an important signal to the european citizens as another important step is taken towards a europe for citizens
then there is the wreckage there is confusion about this
the forthcoming visit of the prisons by a delegation from the european parliament will give new impetus to the reform of the criminal justice system in turkey
my own region the west midlands is a case in point
our view is that what innovation needs most of all is freedom and the right conditions rather than institutions and more support measures which tend to take us in the wrong direction
only a few weeks ago the presidents of rwanda and of the democratic republic of congo concluded a new peace agreement only to be at each others throats again a few days later
i share the concerns about animal welfare but i want realistic regulation that also allows trade in animals which is legitimate and properly policed and i would suggest that we do not need additional regulation
this means that a dutch person is able to take the test in dutch while hungarian polish czech slovak slovenian estonia latvian lithuanian and maltese applicants cannot take the test in their mother tongue but must take it in one of the 11 languages of the 15 old member states
the eu is again to enter into a fisheries agreement with an african state
commissioner mandelsons recent statements have been alarming and unacceptable
the commission therefore decided to support the common position which even if far from ideal does nonetheless represent a significant improvement over present arrangements under the current directive
commissioner fischler is most welcome
presidentinoffice of the council fi mr president ladies and gentlemen the european union and its citizens need effective agencies that work transparently
motorways of the seas is also given a separate mention in the white paper on transport it is therefore only natural to include it in this regulation
the other 107 are about safety at sea and that is what we are dealing with here
this is a very bizarre element of the climate package because this process ensures naturally that more co2 is emitted
mr president my point concerns the next four hours
democracy and freedom are the pillars without which no improvement is sustainable
solidarity with developing countries is necessary for genuine solidarity with people on low incomes in europe and the rest of the world
it is simply unreasonable that complete information should only be provided in english and french in all the twentyfive member states
although the rapporteur has tabled proposals for amendments that seek to introduce assurances and safeguards for fundamental rights freedoms and guarantees for example for the transfer and management of personal information and data it should be noted that europol is bound by agreements with third countries not least with the usa this does not change the general tenor of the initiatives that have been proposed
documents received see minutes
mr president when the european union talks about human rights the people have every reason to worry
parliament is going to decide on that tomorrow and that is always a sign to show where we want to go in the future
when you know that sometimes on food bread for example only up to a maximum 10 of the value of the bread can be related to the wheat i simply cannot imagine how this figure of 75 can be right
it is quite clear therefore from the wording of article 280 that we are not only dealing with fraud but with all and any illegal activity that threatens the financial interests of the community
mr president mr presidentinoffice of the council commissioner ladies and gentlemen the european constitution has successfully overcome its first two hurdles in the shape of the convention and the intergovernmental conference
dialogue between the various cultures needs to be established and efforts made to integrate the different communities without of course neglecting the minority communities within the eu
i have many obligations to fulfil
most of us use vehicles on these roads
question no 11 by h034801
it mr president ladies and gentlemen the need for legislative proposals always to be compatible with fundamental rights may be a good route to a serious resumption of the debate on the real european constitutional process with no clumsy attempts to revive a treaty that died on impact with the public
democracy and freedom are based on the application of rules
every year it causes the deaths of 650 000 people and a further 79 000 adults die as a result of passive smoking
that is the view that the commission has taken quite rightly when basing the recommendation on article 157 of the treaty on the competitiveness of related industrial activities thereby making codecision possible
this is why we will continue to work in harmony with all the member states with the council and also with countries outside europe that are particularly involved in combating piracy
i am in no doubt that the forum supported by the commission and mrs cederschild will highlight new issues and new problems
these victims are sold and resold treated as slaves in a modern europe a europe about which we are proud to say is based on respect for human rights
one only has to look at the data supplied on schools connections and the use of the internet by teachers to understand the enormous discrepancies and major inequalities that remain in the european union
this has been based on a threepronged strategy by the commission security of supply sustainability and competitiveness
as for human rights in cambodia the commission and the member states have been officially invited by cambodia to nominate and dispatch observers to monitor the local elections
just allow me to give you an example involving money from the solidarity fund
we have only 13 months to bring along the decisions on this very important maybe the most important proposal this mandate for the european parliament and the commission and the council
although it refers to future developments it fails to set specific commitments or timetables
we just need to have faith in ourselves to position ourselves well and to spread positive news rather than the usual negative rumours
my thanks to the french presidency of the council and to dominique bussereau because i am quite sure that it was the personal commitment and all the work done by the presidencys teams that have enabled us today to submit a very satisfactory result which i call on parliament to approve without reservation
i just want to add that this communication is a vital element in our efforts to reach agreement in the council on the services proposal
moreover the commission has undertaken following agreement between parliament and the council to submit a legislative proposal aimed at prohibiting the use of products containing cmr substances when it is scientifically proven that exposing the public at large to such substances involves risks
the crisis in the sector requires appropriate instruments and i believe that these will be used
time has proved and the practice employed by the ombudsman is an example of this that the powers and the competences granted him have always been used to fulfil the central objective of his activity in his ceaseless quest to improve the sound administrative practices of the european union
the limit of 3 of gdp for the public deficits of the member states of the economic and monetary union and the limit of 60 in relation to gdp for public debt remain in force
in that case question time is closed
mr president thomas friedmann an american gave it as his opinion that this war is not a war of necessity but one that is clearly deliberate
mr president should i be unable to speak about the content i would only say that the previous remark from the ppe side of the house is complete baloney
thank you very much
fr broadly speaking we can only agree with the new strategy decided on at the helsinki european council of 10 and 11 december 1999 that aims to open negotiations with all eastern european candidate countries but not at any cost
this proposal is one of numerous initiatives seeking to combat unorthodox immigration
the european parliament must continue to play a fundamental part in this stage of the project of constitutional reform
so without asking anyone you can actually pay direct to the farmer up to eur 6 000 to help immediately if necessary
they are expressly provided for in the proposals
it is critical therefore that every step is taken to ensure the quality of the administration of european affairs by the eu institutions
my colleagues responsible for regional policy enlargement and agriculture are presently examining these requests
further investigation into the events surrounding the loss of the prestige is needed
the development concerned is the ever increasing number of senior citizens in our societies whose supreme concern will be the issue of health
that is exactly what sustainable development is all about making sure that we do it the european way ensuring that all these three elements are covered by an ambitious policy for jobs and growth in europe
it is clear that the eu should be playing a leadership role in johannesburg
i really believe that the ageing of the population will first need a response from us on the societal level but this response on the societal level is also an opportunity for the european industry because if our industry gets the societal response from the policymakers from those who are responsible in areas in regions in countries and at european level then they can start to market systems services and items for the elderly
i would like to thank the council and the commission for their hard work and i am glad we have moved away from just a list of countries where human rights abuses take place
that manifestly borders on the indefensible
the success of the antismoking campaign shows us that multinational companies such as the tobacco companies are not unbeatable
in eu debates for example delocalisation is not regarded as an opportunity but a threat to jobs in countries where production costs are higher than in countries where they are lower
accordingly the direction taken by european cooperation with iraq is consistent with the process of reconstructing the country and restoring democracy
the council has not yet been able to adopt the commission proposal to this effect and i appeal urgently not only to the government of the republic of cyprus but also to a number of other member states to ensure as a matter of urgency that the policies of the international community and of the european union in relation to cyprus are implemented
we made our views clear at first reading
my sincere thanks go to them for their contributions and for the way in which they cooperated so willingly with me
this process is justified on the grounds that it is less cumbersome but the truth is that it is the consumers who lose out
it will mean that the map of europe will be redrawn
the terror organisation rejects the twostate concept and wants to turn israel into an islamic state
joint motion for a resolution rc b601602007
rather than draw up a long list of quantitative objectives covering every conceivable aspect and then measure success in terms of the amount of reports and paper generated we must clarify the objectives and ensure good communication
go and get yourselves killed with your ethics with your morals with your quests for absolutes with your digressions
madam president ladies and gentlemen the commission welcomes parliaments initiative in presenting a resolution on the human rights situation in tibet
its first recommendation and the only specific one is to demand that all necessary steps be taken to keep inflation below the mythical threshold of 2
let us draw up our own policy we cannot see it anywhere
it must do so through a common policy with choices that are mutually agreed upon and maintained and not by means of ineffective initiatives which isolate certain member states
we also advocate an amendment of the current interinstitutional agreements governing the quality of eu law
this move had the backing and support of our partners in the benelux countries and italy
similarly we should not try to export our own social problems because even if we could export them they could well come back to haunt us in the form of migration problems
it seeks to exonerate airlines from a whole range of shortcomings by shifting fault onto airports and air traffic control yet it is the fact that all airlines operate in order to make a profit that puts passengers at risk
next the commission has endeavoured to arrange seminars for journalists we hope to reach at least five hundred journalists who will come to brussels to familiarise themselves with the constitution and talk with forums comprising meps attending the convention and representatives of civil society
i hope that the committee on foreign affairs human rights common security and defence policy will prepare a recommendation which we can vote for unanimously or at least by a majority during the second september partsession
we wish to remove bans upon and threats in connection with converting from one religion to another
sustainable development also requires changes in the way in which work is organised and in the use of time
therefore as well as signing up to the additional protocol of the atomic energy agency i also believe that we can contribute to increasing stability in the region because we must point out that this region needs stability
commissioner thank you for that comprehensive answer
situation in zimbabwe
the report by giuseppe gargani on behalf of the committee on legal affairs on a strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment 20062006inia600802006
i would like to remind everyone that it was not particularly easy then either
i request the commission to present systematically information regarding the situation of the roma reflecting the concrete steps taken for integration social inclusion the ways in which the european funds have been used and the results achieved
finally the abolition of export subsidies for animal transport would not only show more compassion for animals but also protect the environment and help the people who suffer as a result of transit traffic
i cannot go to the farmers of the region that i represent here and tell them something like this because there is no possible explanation for this and therefore i should like the commission to clearly explain the reason for this incongruity
one example is the attempt to create a proper database
another huge propaganda project to distort and hide the truth
the new serbian parliament will have a key role in implementing the constitution soundly especially in enhancing the protection of minorities as well as establishing forms of local selfgovernment that are in line with european standards
it is clear that there should have been a discussion on what a system of the type we now want to introduce will mean for poor candidate countries
there is no doubt that the eus 2003 budget is a major challenge
it europe cannot and must not tolerate discrimination against people on account of their ethnicity
in fact iran has the highest number of executions in the world after china
what is to be particularly welcomed in this connection is the fact that the member states are to be given more flexibility in transposing the proposal
enhancing the quality of life of older people
if the commission is to have the support of the member states the member states governments must have a major part to play in its appointment even if this sometimes prolongs the decisionmaking process
this is the opposite of what the rapporteurs original text says
echo has already committed eur 25 million for assistance to idps in afghanistan and refugees in pakistan this year
we must keep a very close eye on the situation because if it were to continue to worsen not only would the people of guinea suffer but so too could the whole of that region of africa as the deepening internal conflict would spread to neighbouring countries
we repeat our demand for the total freedom of establishment and movement for all those who live and work in one of the european union countries and their entitlement to the same political legal and social rights as citizens of the community
our decision should balance environmental concerns and the interests of the industry
i do not think that that is the solution but an evaluation will in any case be able to shed some light on the matter
firstly while it is true that the public finances of the majority of eu countries improved significantly in 2006 i have serious doubts as to whether this is a result of the reform of the stability and development pact as the commission makes out in my view it is more likely the result of a good economic climate
if we really want and that is what we uphold after all that europe is a europe that is united in diversity we will need to actively invest in this
i believe that we must try to bring this element of european life and of the european social model more into the spotlight
that is why the amendments referred to earlier by my honourable friend mr catania and others must also be adopted because they supplement the most extensive and very important report by our honourable friend mr takkula
we are seeking information and not the resignation of the commission as some have rumoured
presidentinoffice to succeed you will need to build consensus
madam president on behalf of the committee on the environment i thank our commissioners for the work we do with them often constructive often with great thought often with what i hope is constructive criticism

mr president it is very late now and very few of us are left but nevertheless we are dealing with a very important issue
the truth is that if nothing is done the freedom of circulation for shipping in the gulf of aden and off the coast of somalia may well disappear entirely with the massive consequences that would of course ensue

yes globalisation results in relocation
i agree one hundred per cent that the member states must take adequate measures to guarantee affordable energy prices
madam president the reclassification of financial swaps and forward rate agreements has been delayed for more than a year while the council of ministers of finance of the european union made it clear when it met that it would not accept the initial proposal from the commission because with the method of accounting for these transactions possible situations of excessive public deficit might not be detected
the commission will continue to exert pressure on the italian government to end the crisis and intends to proceed with the legal action against italy
travel agencies and tour operators outside the eu will have to pay vat when they provide services to european customers and conversely european travel agencies will be exempt from vat when they provide services to customers residing outside the eu thereby reestablishing healthy and fair competition in the european internal market

i thank mrs mcguinness very much for her very laudatory remarks
the commission continues to cooperate closely with the member states of the european union in an effort to express our position and dissatisfaction with the iraqi side
we are offering closer cooperation across the spectrum of our relations from political dialogue to economic integration on the basis of commitment to common values
todays debate is a quite new experience and what makes it so is the fact that the commission first listens to parliament
the council is not authorised to comment on a matter that does not fall within the area of competence conferred on it by the treaties
if however we look for example at the area of freedom justice and security we can see that over the last year it is the context rather than the text that is the problem
the ombudsman has an important role to play and i do not share the concerns of those who maintain that 70 of complaints fall outside his remit
the notice is still in force although of course references to the orange juice case which honourable members will recall no longer apply
we were trying to make the point that if you want to create some monies in category 2 you need our agreement unless you want to take it from existing structural funds

i am speaking in relation to those referred to the committee on economic and monetary affairs
the debate is closed
that is a real problem
the difference between the two reports lies in the fact that the commission s report is merely descriptive whereas parliament s report provided assessments and proposals
there are two reasons for this firstly because we have adopted extremely urgent measures which are already being applied in advance and secondly because part of the erika i and erika ii packages are already in force and are obliging for example countries which have not been carrying out port controls to do so
it mr president ladies and gentlemen i would like to remind you that public opinion in italy is perfectly well aware of what is going on in the roma camps
this has to be discussed
let us also point out however that north korea is not a signatory to the nonproliferation treaty
this raises the act to a level very similar to that of a judgment
this is an absolute must
as we have not yet settled on a solution we should not support amendments excluding specific potential solutions
this has to be a benefit in what we call ripoff britain by driving down high prices in our own overpriced internal home market
there will be a public consultation on the scope by the end of 2007 or the beginning of 2008 i do not know yet exactly when but that will be the time for parliament and our main stakeholders to come forward with proposals to see what we are going to do with the universal service
i would like to begin by saying that countries in the area have reacted calmly and responsibly
in other words not only are member states civil servants being absorbed into the maw of the community but the courts are too
and i was particularly pleased to see that the council has saved mr barrosos bacon by transferring five billion unspent euros into the recovery plan
will they relate specifically to the job market or more globally to all the basic factors which influence employment policies
first of all since this is a matter of finding the model as you say we must take account of the fact that there are certain practices in the member states and that before deciding on the model we must first discuss the calculation methods used in the various member states
i approve of the coordination of economic and employment policy guidelines
i believe that it would be foolish at this stage for us to choose any other approach than continuing to provide this constructive support for mr baker
the complicated regulations which even brussels eurocrats often find confusing are a major contributor to the defective nature of the system
i would like to thank the rapporteur mr cappato who has put a lot of time and energy into this file
i disagree in fact with the approach adopted which often proves unsuitable for meeting the needs of the african side including both the institutions and the private sector
with regard to the steps which must be taken i believe we must encourage perseverance
el mr president development under the lisbon strategy guided by the principle of support for competitiveness ie increasing the profitability of the monopoly business groups in the european union not only intensifies to the utmost the exploitation of the working class and of workers generally but also severely aggravates environmental problems by systematically destroying marine ecosystems and the biodiversity of the seas and causing a steady deterioration in the quality of sea water
i do not share that view and i do not mean that as a backhanded compliment as we have some very good staff but that is not the measure of efficiency and effectiveness
fao statistics over a comparable period show that food prices have risen by 37 over a 12month period
my question then is as follows what is the difference between a joint flight and a group flight
this precedent would have been set at a particularly inopportune moment at the very time when the community is preparing for its enlargement to new members

after all very positive things can be mentioned in this area too
i am convinced that all those you are addressing in the motion for a resolution will be responsive to your call
let the voters then choose between them in a referendum in every country on the same day
de mr president i should like to start by congratulating mr voggenhuber on his report and also declaring my support for him in his fight for more rights for our citizens
mr president i have never been a great fan of the peoples mujahedin of iran whose philosophical origins are islamistmarxist which is a contradiction in terms and they were of course for many years under the protection of saddam hussein the butcher of baghdad whom they supported militarily
older workers need to be able to develop their skills to a higher degree but we also need to increase health and safety in workplaces
that especially applies to countries with limited technical capacity in this area for it is crucial to ensure that they genuinely recommend the imports and are able to handle them
in this regard we note that 80 of counterfeit products originate from internet trade and only 20 from actual smuggling
as a result we must ask once again what is the council s position on the necessary communitisation of fishing rights in european union waters in accordance with the principles laid down in the treaties
its name however is irrelevant
the next item is the speech by mr barroso presidentelect of the european commission
next i wish to remind you that the opinion of the socialist group in the european parliament is that the budget should be refocused on the fundamental missions employment growth and innovation as our colleague mr färm said however before finishing i would like to make a point of saying that the real future of the union depends on this revision and i hope that the future parliament makes use of the bge report so that it is able to achieve our european ambition in the face of the national selfinterests relayed daily via the prevarications of the council
commission question time
mr crowley mr president the excessive deficit procedure is being applied to france and it is subject to the procedure laid down in article 1047 of the treaty
the people with whom i am in contact are concerned at the high rates of unemployment in the european union
the constitution has served parliament in its capacity as a legislative power best according it its central statute
most of us approach this topic based on our situation and we often forget that we should be thinking about the workers who have to work under these conditions
this is also an area where we can take more firm action as part of the policy for protecting competition and consumers
mrry also appropriately highlights the fact that in certain european union member states more restrictions are currently imposed on the movement of workers from the new member states than was the case when the treaty on accession was signed
the resolution which the european parliament has adopted following the purvis report on the future of the biotechnology sector seems to us to be too soothing and often even full of pitfalls
everyday they face a lack of work and now all of a sudden we had the news that a factory employing eight hundred and fifty people to produce jeans is going to leave to start manufacturing outside the european union
i should like first of all to thank our rapporteur mr garriga polledo even though he cannot be here since it is clearly a mammoth task to examine the budget
another is to improve communication and more effectively target information to cover specific information gaps
commissioner frattini you are denying the obvious
likewise vast tracts of the amazonian and indonesian rainforests are being torn up to make way for biofuel crops like palm oil and for food crops like soya releasing millions of tonnes of co2 into the atmosphere and threatening to destroy our global air conditioning system
rapporteur mr president parliament has moved from its firstreading position on the electricity and gas directive
oh it was not as bad as all that
let us hope that it will come to a speedy end
this parliament has to be realistic rational and forwardlooking
that is why i would welcome a body that can unambiguously implement the best possible safety rules in europe
the terrorist group laskar jihad for it is nothing less than a terrorist group is digging the grave of anything that might be called religious life
it is on this basis that the common agricultural policy must be developed further
therefore i advocate further decoupling
at last there is a single document with targets which can hopefully only be developed
i am well aware that citizens of the old union holiday in those countries
it is the austrian model that the 2006 reform of the cap intends to generalise throughout europe including the lowland areas
on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs i drafted an opinion on mr garganis report which focuses on simplifying the legislation and in that regard i should like to make three observations
i think that given all the problems we face and since i heard you mention courage earlier it would show courage to persevere with the precautionary principle and take time to verify the facts of the situation
i can therefore only accept amendments 1 and 5 which correspond to the provisions of the plan such as the request to specify the status of the eastern cod stock in the first recital
the next item is the debate on the legislative and work programme of the commission for 2007
we thank you
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
we know our history more than 500 000 roma were killed in the death camps
stepping up repression wherever this may be ireland the basque country corsica etc with contempt for the quest for a political solution has not yet shown that it is the way to stamp out terrorism
certainly in slovakia with its weak economy and roma and hungarian minorities which are not favoured by a majority of people poverty not only incites an aversion to the eu but also creates internal conflict
language learning
smokers are addicts slaves of persistent decadeslong propaganda
at the moment when the world is being threatened by deflation and the situation is being aggravated by the tendency of some countries to hastily cut their vat rate as part of a keynesian policy it is obvious that setting this target of 2 is no longer just for show
to begin with i should like to address the social dimension of globalisation from the perspective of citizenship
the commission took note of the findings of the tbr report at its session on 7 may and authorised its transmission to the council
my group is in favour of extending the programme to include the european unions neighbouring countries and also the extra attention for shifting more of the freight that is being carried along coastal roads to the motorways of the sea
i should also add that joining the eu was a winwin situation and i would therefore like to thank the european parliament for welcoming us new member states
we are not in danger of creating a precedent this case is unique
in fairness such tactics occur everywhere are legal and the government of ukraine would have faced lukashenkastyle criticism if these candidates had been rejected
what i find worthy of criticism about this work programme is the fact that in parallel with the efforts by g6 states to do something about legal migration and by the few states gathered around the federal republic of germany that have launched the prüm convention parallel structures are developing into a third pillar outside the third pillar without the commission whose role as guardian of treaties is about more than making laws intervening or making any kind of forthright public comment
presidentinoffice may i remind you that according to the commission in lower saxony for the same work on the same construction site a worker from another member state can be paid half the minimum wage applicable to a german worker
de madam president ladies and gentlemen this is an appropriate and important project to realise energy efficiency and save more energy
and as you know from a macrofinancial stability point of view i as the commissioner for economic and monetary affairs am always ready to contribute to the discussions in the committee on economic and monetary affairs and in this parliament
turning now to the parliament discharge we have to be very clear that we in parliament cannot throw stones at the commission and demand from them for example a certain level of transparency if we are not willing to demand the same of ourselves
i am willing to receive any information that the honourable member can give us on the economic implications of these criminal activities
i am sure my friend mr lannoye will not hold it against me if i say i attach particular importance to mrs morgantinis report
good management of this useful though expensive service next year should be on the agenda of all the institutions
i thank mr ransdorf for his very kind words but i think it is wrong to accuse somebody industry lobby or not because industry provides jobs and creates growth
section iv court of justice
i agree with you
the new member states need more funds for the development of rural areas for reasons which include reducing the labourintensity of farming and to speed up the transfer of land from social and small farms to largescale market farms
once italy exported fashion nowadays it exports racism
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the heat of the debate clearly shows that we are dealing with the heart of a real social issue and i would like to thank mrs buitenweg for having tackled it with her report
their efforts give social cohesion a very personal face
although the first summit took place only four years ago the european and indian cultures go back thousands of years
at present we actually have no chance of getting anywhere near the necessary majority in the council
perhaps it is simply a matter of ensuring that they are not accepted into the union on reasonable terms
political dialogue is undeniably one key tool in the promotion of human rights
i am not saying this to be critical but because until the council changes its policy european integration will be weak
we need to reform the security council
it is only natural that at such a time economic issues should take second place to matters of life and death
the question of the extent to which we adapt the directives legislatively is certainly an important aspect
no one can question the priority given to afghanistan
as for the other institutions allow me just to say this access for citizens should be paramount
this is why multilingualism must offer new solutions to europes citizens and our society
moreover these bananas are produced in ecuador by 10yearold children who are paid usd 2 a day who inhale pesticides who have asthma who have problems with their balance and who suffer from cerebellar ataxia
this is the point that i think my colleagues mr rouek and mr pohjamo made earlier on
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on 10 july 2008
buddhist monks have written no on their monastery walls to send their message to burmese civilians for the constitutional referendum in may
apart from the fact that these acts of piracy are on the increase it seems clear that they are no longer happening just along the coast but are tending to extend further out to international waters disrupting not only the activities of fishing and cargo vessels in transit but also and this is very serious of vessels operating within the framework of humanitarian programmes particularly the world food programme which supplies essential aid to the very many displaced populations in somalia
the public dimension of the danish water supply services is very active in demanding as high levels of protection as possible and in demanding an end to possible sources of pollution
this is not a political issue colleagues it is purely humanitarian and it is very urgent
the only way society stays together is if the multipliers in society function so we need an upgrading of the may meeting and we need a broadening
it has the problem of the national allocation plan first of all
instead i urge the commission to concentrate on delivering the economic reform agenda
a wide range of instruments are available to us for measures at community level including legislation the open method of coordination financial instruments in particular the european social fund and social dialogue
approximately 40 of those condemned to death are juveniles
let us put a stop to playing games with numbers and talk about what we have to do and how much it will cost and then we will be able to talk about own resources and the allocation of tasks and about who has to do what
the question is do we want to internalise that in the cost price do we want the polluter to pay
pl madam president i would like to congratulate my colleague zita gurmai because she has done something wonderful she has mastered and prepared an excellent report in an area that would appear to be very technical and masculine
as several other members have said three million people die in the world every year for lack of drinking water
we are deeply grateful therefore to the secretarygeneral for his ceaseless work in defending the multilateral system
the vote on the first two reports that we debated will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
the rest follows the primacy of collective regulation over individual exceptions the fact that there are european areas of responsibility that respect national prerogatives in the social field and that there is a community dimension governed by subsidiarity of specific regulatory competence to guarantee minimum standards which give a meaning to the european dimension not reducing it to mere squeezing onto the market the fight against the underground labour market and finally the rejection of the logic of trade
their condition is worsening day by day
there is no difference between the two products just that one is sold in the us and the other is not
piracy prospers thanks to the weakness of governments
i must tell you that you are fully entitled to have this presentation because the european parliament is really the institution behind the convention and thus the draft constitution
when i worked as a professor i was saddened to find that some universities particularly those that always appear right at the top of the major rankings for example british elite universities such as oxford and cambridge were extremely reserved when it came to the erasmus programme in contrast to many other universities
it is true that there are no existing instruments at community level
this is not about establishing who was right who was to blame or anything else of the sort but about finding a way to resolve this situation
we welcome the proposals to keep eurostat services inhouse and to review current contracts
all proposals that improve on the current directive 89381 are also positive specifically in the areas of the levels of quality and safety in the various phases of collection processing storage and distribution of blood
report jacques toubon
particularly when that interest is one that can plead consequences right across europe in terms of our economic viability
what have become of the best interests of the child
this is all the more distressing if we think back to the discussions we held a few short months ago then as you have just reminded us we were considering the content of various draft proposals which seemed to be bringing the prospect of permanent peace in the region closer
this leads me to wonder to what extent the ongoing privatisation of public services for example the railways and the postal service which has not produced all the results that had been hoped for will turn out to have been a grave mistake
i hope that the need for such a border police will be demonstrated and that the convention on the future of europe will give impetus to this project
it is important in strategic terms and is also important as a regional actor
i would like to urge the commission to draft ambitious common targets for the member states to reduce the dangerous and harmful consumption of alcohol
those of us who sit on the committee on foreign affairs human rights common security and defence policy take an interest in the equal treatment of the candidate countries but as parliaments fundamental rights are involved we especially support the position of the committee on budgets as well for budgetary law is the prerogative of any parliament and must not be set aside even in a situation such as this
we will be ready to discuss with you all details of this very important set of proposals
that would prevent nationalist reactions on the part of some of our colleagues who do not agree with their country being mentioned
it is probable that after the war much of the work we have been doing for decades will have to be done again
the investigation into the reasons and consequences of this accident has reached a dead end at the moment
mr president as draftsman for the committee on constitutional affairs i would like to draw the attention of the commissioners and my fellow members to two fundamental aspects of the amendments we have tabled which i hope parliament and the committee on budgets will be able to accept

if a group such as falun gong which is banned in china were also to be banned in hong kong it would be a serious offence against the principle of one country two systems
eurobarometer found that on the whole europeans supported the development of nanotechnology with approximately 55 in favour
there has as yet been no change in the situation and further attacks like that of 29 september remain possible
the focus on alcohol abuse by young people and children is important but it would be a strategic mistake to pretend that only young people are affected by alcohol abuse and its adverse effects in the european union
this event on the eve of the lahti meeting is clearly of particularly crucial significance to us
the region does not need more armed forces it needs fewer arms fewer armed forces
i do not know what secret relations you have with the author of the question but unfortunately we cannot continue
this has no effect on the capacity of a european country to welcome incomers rather the contrary
in important areas the proposals do not go as far as the cartagena protocol itself and in other areas the proposals create an unnecessary lack of clarity
that is a great success for the european parliament and it shows that parliament can resolve such complex issues as deregulation of the market in postal services which is further justification for the additional powers entrusted to it by the reform treaty
in this context the situation concerning the reopening of the halki school of theology also remains shrouded in uncertainty for the time being
i should like firstly to congratulate commissioner verheugen for the extraordinary report on turkey with which he has provided us
at this stage i would say that it is not a question of food prices or the use of biofuels because globally biofuels are used on a very small scale and they definitely have not had any impact at this stage on the price of foodstuffs
it is estimated that this initiative alone could save up to 2 500 lives every year after it is fully rolled out in europe
indeed the us example demonstrates what happens when the consumption of alcohol is criminalised young people turn to designer drugs
has the commission in this respect achieved enough or has it only considered policy that is already in the pipeline
they want again to give themselves the right to defer the sixth amendment and if we now lie down quietly like little lambs then they will believe that they have the right to carry on doing the same thing
it can standardise the rules on air safety and environmental protection and

let me set out what the targets are free and compulsory education for all halving adult illiteracy by 2015 eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary schools by 2005 and extending learning opportunities for adults and young people and improvements in the quality of education provided
it is appalling that someones life should depend on an opinion that was never tested for its veracity
as for the second part of amendment 28 modal shift between nonroad modes is not within the scope of the programme because it would lead to unacceptable distortions of competition and does not focus on the main overall programme objective
so we have no choice but to retable all the amendments on important matters such as exceptions at second reading
i would like to point out to the house that to date only four countries have signed the hague convention and only eight have ratified it
the committee on foreign affairs human rights common security and defence policy and in particular the rapporteur mr laschet are to be commended on the production of this report
as regards the most relevant types of impacts of the various policy options the assessment will aim to assess a the economywide effects of the alternative tax reforms on the competitiveness of the eu on growth of the eu economy and welfare b their respective effects on companies compliance costs and c notably their respective impacts on national corporate tax bases and on tax administration costs
today before this house i should like to make two points
one possible innovation is to work more closely on remedies because remedies are sometimes either not applied or not applied swiftly which is the same problem
the amendments under consideration by the parliament concern several key issues on which i should like to comment
the winner is the european parliament because as pat cox has rightly said we have had an open election keenly but fairly contested
in these circumstances however i do not understand why it is that when we reach this point the commission and therefore also the commissioner are no longer calling for transparency
i would very much like answers to those questions
those in brief are the specific measures available under the new financial perspective for the outermost regions
i wonder what happened to the social process
the clear commitment of this parliament to this cause has been essential and i want to thank you once again for all your support
of course both the ngos and mr howitt could be wrong
the convention still has to meet and debate
there are key sectors such as the telecommunications energy water transport television and media sectors in which the governments are both referees and players they have to juggle with a burdensome conflict of interests they are not regulators and legislators they themselves are entrepreneurs with large multinational businesses which are sometimes used for political and other ends
in my opinion no
these include the budget the services directive the development of cooperation on domestic matters improved consular cooperation enlargement of the schengen area and reform of the eus external policies which is the matter closest to my own heart and which is very close to completion thanks to mrschüssels team in brussels
but there is indeed no room for complacency in europe
the report focuses mainly on tuna but also covers demersal species
although the outbreak was debated in the plenary last night there will be no resolution on the subject
following this piece of legislation if it goes through tomorrow our consumers should be assured that nothing from the commercial hunt will be sold on europes market

madam president may i start by thanking the presidencyinoffice for their opening comments comments that were farsighted balanced and sensible adjectives that we have come increasingly to associate with the czech presidency
olaf has a clear strategy
we have to pool our efforts to organise our civil defence response that is truly a job to be tackled at union level and no longer just by the member states

the text for a regulation now adopted by the conciliation committee will encourage the continued development of alternative technologies and the adoption of existing technologies nevertheless making possible sustainable operational models to achieve the objective
this is our obligation as the european union especially in a situation where the sarkozy plan is not being carried out for georgia and we are not able to ensure as an arbiter as the european union that relations between georgia and russia are regulated in accordance with international law
in simple terms it is ultimately about somehow regulating what is referred to as the services directive in the transport sector
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i would first like to thank all those members who took part in the debates on my report in committee and in particular the shadow rapporteurs of the various political groups mrs oomenruijten mr bowe mrs schrling and mr sjstedt

finally i am pleased that we have a section in the report on disabled peoples rights
this is the reality
as far as this last point is concerned i applaud the fact that this report points out that the afghan constitution still does not guarantee freedom of religion because unfaithfulness to islam remains a criminal offence
in addition public executions encourage aggressive behaviour amongst the population
naturally we need a european approach
we must seek a series of measures to increase safety
i would like to remind you that we held a hearing in the committee on fisheries on this issue and that the experts stressed the need for the international council for the exploration of the sea to identify for each species the stocks which can be exploited sustainably and they also asked for greater scientific rigour as regards sampling schemes and more concise data
i have just come from a meeting of the competitiveness group where we discussed the small business act that is the working title where we want to address all the issues connected with smes in an organised way i would also like to mention that although today we are deciding about financial participation from the community side in fact this has already begun and more than 200 have applied for the first call which is an important success
the level of payment appropriations in our draft budget is therefore realistic and adapted to the needs of the union
what do we expect
there is not much time until the next discharge which we start on in november
in the czech republic we have a clear interpretation let us return the union to its original core values which have yet to be fulfilled
accordingly the commission would like make a declaration that has been previously circulated in the institutions and it is as follows the commission reaffirms its objective to ensure the best possible environmental protection as laid in article 953 of the treaty
we seem understandably to have lost all awareness of common security since 1990 which is why we need to ensure that relations between the united states of america and europe are strengthened in every other political field
the heads of state and government have opted for liberal choices by favouring the speedingup of deregulation and liberalisation wage moderation and flexibility and insecurity in the labour market
theoretically if there is a need the baltic states could use one additional energy terminal
is this the start of eu harmonisation of tax policy across the union something they said would never happen
furthermore i am also delighted by the current efforts of my city zaragoza which will host expo 2008 and which within that context wishes and this has been proposed within the context of the objective of promoting water and sustainable development to restore the navigability of the river ebro
it is only one specific lobby that is arguing the point about market migration
it is not helpful when the operators and the unions now say we are about to reach an agreement
on that basis we want to work together with the member states to promote safety standards to see to it that flag states take greater responsibility and to ensure better protection of coastal states
for these reasons we along with the majority of the committee on agriculture are against anticipating the results of the midterm review
i believe that the communitys farmers and inhabitants will understand this important message in terms of providing financial resources for additional support
mr president commissioner as you will imagine as a cypriot i am particularly sensitive on the subject of protecting bathing waters given that i come from an island
i should also like to thank the house for the massive support the european parliament has already given me on many occasions with regard to the fight against counterfeit medicines

i can endorse the procedural points mentioned by mrs buitenweg
that must not be taken to mean that there is no constitution even if the treaty does not bear the name of constitution we germans have been living for sixty years with a constitution that is called the basic law and it makes a great constitution
does this say something to you
there is no doubt about it the competitiveness of the european union as a whole is one of the challenges of the twentyfirst century and as the rapporteur rightly points out the development of research and technology is an essential element in that one that must of course also be in the areas of cohesion policy the basis of development not least of the less developed regions

however there are problems elsewhere as well as can be seen from the infringements too many instances of the authorities sending in special commissioners too much confusion between the regulations on waste and on energy leading to unacceptable practices for instance the practice under which the energy produced from waste has for years been considered in italy as renewable energy with enormous incentives eur 30 billion over ten years under a measure known as cip 6 which have seriously distorted both energy policies and waste policies and have also led to somewhat paradoxical situations where for instance there are seven million tonnes of waste fuel pellets in campania which even if the incinerator which should dispose of them were to open could not be burnt in it

in order to do this it needs to monitor with the utmost attention the plans to regain the correct position of those countries including my own since i am spanish that have strayed into an excessive deficit situation
the proposal put forward by the commission concerning the mining waste directive and published if i remember rightly on 2 june concentrates more upon the management of waste

it should enable us in the long run to have community and national standards that are easier to apply and less costly
the report by michel barnier which was delivered to me and to mr barroso at the beginning of may has become the basis of a presidency document that has enabled us to agree on a very precise programme of tasks for the next eight presidencies
i am certain that this is a good task for the second phase of analysis because it could produce proposals that will ultimately help to achieve what all of us the commission the council and parliament want for europe to add value for people for europe to defend our common values and for europe ultimately to make peoples lives more effective fairer freer and better supported
in this respect it is also an extremely important area when it comes to audits by the european court of auditors

i would suggest that we do not change the agenda today
i would like to point out that these entirely rational conclusions were reached by the heads of the 27 member states and the commission in a situation where the eu is facing a sharp rise in unemployment and a decline in the economy and the lisbon treaty has not been approved
what a joy it would be to be able in that way to relive the magic moments of larroseur arrosé that is what i had in mind when i was working on this council recommendation
real parties do not emerge because the structures of a state require the organisation of a competitive struggle at election time but because there are people with common ideas interests and activities
the various eu countries due to their high energy dependence aspire to dominate the exploitation of existing energy resources hence the proposal to create an energy strand within the common foreign and security policy
that is a legitimate question and in chechnya a colonial power has for years been waging a colonial war that day after day brings forth monsters

i should like to join wholeheartedly with mr corbett in asking for immediate action to be taken
we cannot support calls for increasing the eu budget
if there is impunity the police can do what they want
this word mainly indicates a majority but not necessarily a majority of more than 50
speaking in general terms i would have been glad if the presidency of the council had been present to take note of the commissions strategic work programme for many many things that the president of the commission has come here with his commissioners to put before us can be realised only if the men and women in the individual governments of the eu whom the council represents put into effect those things that the commission proposes and we enact

in any event the commissions communication maintains the principle that an excessive deficit must be corrected quickly but as mr zalm has said the influence of other economic factors other than the intensity of the effort being called for and being made by the country in question on the budgetary results must be considered
we therefore do not think that this final period of reflection which we consider to be necessary within parliament will cause any major difficulties
yet in essence the chain of measures should not be broken
parliament adopted the resolution
the examples of the irish referendum and the preceding referendums in france and holland show that we cannot be offhand about our citizens views
the commissions actions are not only concerned with domestic impacts i think we all have a commitment to securing a level playing field also when we talk about developing countries and so far the commission has mobilised more than eur 300 million in food emergency aid and we are actively promoting a coordinated response at international level in line with the conclusions of the fao summit that took place only two weeks ago

rapporteur de mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen let me begin by translating the title of my report when we speak of biological natural resources we are referring to timber and fish
those promoting the antigrass roots policy have the nerve to call by the name of constitution a text which not only fails to crystallise the democratic achievements of the people but also reduces them to a text which establishes capitalism constitutionally which redistributes power for the benefit of the strong which hands over more national sovereignty to the imperialist eurounifying centre and which dangerously extends the militarisation of the european union

i also call on the house to approve the draft recommendation which seeks to transform the europol convention into a council decision and to thus incorporate it into the institutional system of the european union i would like to point out to mrs frassoni in particular that as far as i am concerned this operation must only be a transitional phase and preferably a short one at that before integral communitarisation takes place in other words before the treaties are merged and the paralysing and archaic distinction between the three pillars is abolished
looking at the berlin declaration we see that the definition of our common values forms an important part of it

another key development is the emphasis on improving the quality of public spending in line with the lisbon strategy
we have not heard any specific commitments for 2003 and 2004 we did not hear any even when we asked mrs schreyer explicitly to tackle urgent problems in the short term
lisbon set farreaching goals for the next decade to create the worlds leading knowledgebased economy by 2010 to create 20 million new jobs across europe by 2010 and to promote economic and social reform which combine competitiveness and social cohesion investing in people and raising skill levels

even so it still has to be said that the letter you mr barroso wrote in response to our questions does nothing to make it any the clearer precisely what portfolio has been allocated to mr orban and that shows that the search for a portfolio in a commission consisting of 27 members can be interpreted to mean only that this commission is being formed on the basis of the treaty of nice a treaty that was in the opinion of those who drafted it not even suitable for 15 states and it certainly does not work for 27 of them

the european union has adopted special guidelines on certain issues and in this way has determined the priorities in its human rights policy
i am referring to the idea of democratic countries in the un being able to assemble and meet within the organisation to draw up joint measures to promote democracy that is an initiative in connection with which the european union could play an important role within the united nations whose difficulties and inertia we took note of when last year someone from a country like libya which is certainly not at the forefront of human rights was elected as head of the human rights commission

indeed it is good that the former labour prime minister of the netherlands mrkok is chairing the task force for the midterm review and is to present his report
in reality however all over the world the nations are gaining strength supported by fervent patriotism apart from in just one area europe where nations and homelands are sacrificed dismantled and demoralised for the benefit of a project that has no strength and no identity while waves of foreign immigrants gradually invade it and the opening up of our economic borders leaves it open to furious competition from the rest of the world

at the same time i believe we should appeal to the provisional iraqi government and to the international coalition forces to allow the efforts to obtain the release of the hostages to proceed unhindered that is to suspend their military operations and bombings which cause so many civilian victims in the iraqi towns and certainly do not help to create a suitable climate for negotiations that may save the captives lives

the commission does not see that the alternative wording proposed by these two amendments would constitute a further improvement
the sabena disaster just goes to show how thousands of jobs can be hit within the shortest period of time
this is an enormous sum from the point of view of the new member states it is a sum that is absolutely essential to reduce the differences in development between old and new member states and to ensure that the division into a first and second class europe does not become permanently entrenched
as regards the proposals for agricultural spending in the coming year i note that the preliminary draft budget adopted by the commission leaves a margin of eur 23 billion under the ceiling agreed by the financial perspective
this has two causes the first being factors over which we have little control such as external indicators global economic influences oil prices and so on whilst the second over which we do indeed have some control has to do with the fact that only very rarely was the lisbon project recast as a national project at member state level

that is what is at stake
as mr sterckx has said i was the rapporteur for parliaments response to the commissions proposals on air transport and the environment last year

madam president this vote is extremely important because now that we have done away with fridays mini partsessions are illegal
progress in implementing the framework agreement is steady
these accusations are moreover illconsidered rather than demonise a nation that has only been independent for 12 years we should be very pleased about the progress it has accomplished on the road to democracy and not interfere in such an arrogant and moralistic way in its internal affairs
in my view these changes would not only make it possible to strengthen budgetary discipline in the member states but would also improve the coordination of fiscal policy at eu level
my group has therefore submitted amendments 45 and 46 to the report on haulage in order to make the opening of the market for cabotage dependent upon the development of equal working conditions and an evaluation in 2012
eurostars is a good example of how things work
the edd group is lending its unqualified support to the assistants legitimate wishes
we should take a wider view of who our energy suppliers are
this policy is irresponsible and in the meantime it keeps the zero deficit in the european budget
it is a compromise which i and my colleagues are very proud of
we must wait and see whether 2003 is an annus mirabilis or an annus horribilis for the european union but since we are now in the year of the goat i would congratulate the greek presidency on its tenacity persistence and determination in pushing through its agenda
the australian government was perfectly entitled to exercise its sovereign right under the law of the sea to secure its borders by refusing the ship access to australian waters
meanwhile spain with by far the largest fleet in the eu escapes with only a 94 cut and italy with the second largest fleet only suffers a cut of 73
the 2007 budget promotes the antilabour lisbon strategy and the united market while at the same time cutting resources for many regions such as greece strengthening inequalities and unequal measures with prospects of it not even being included in the poor cohesion fund
question no 7 by h034001
in addition special measures need to be adopted and financed when such sites are closed down
mr president five years into lisbon in ireland and i wonder where else poverty discrimination and homelessness are alive and well
a concrete example of this socalled multicultural society is the fact that muslims occupy high government offices
i have also stated that invading a country is easy for them but leaving a country is far more difficult and dangerous
i do not view the situation in such a poor light and i can assure you that the czech presidency will not suffer through this in any way and that all of us who have responsibility for managing the eu agenda will undoubtedly do just that
mrpresident i also wish to thank the council for its answer to the question
bureaucrats and politicians are taking the decisions on tasks and resources and they also decide how to allocate funds and on the amounts involved
even though my report focuses on illegal dumping the implications are sadly the same
the trentin report calls for fulfilment of the barcelona strategy confirming the liberal trend of lisbon it calls for greater flexibility in the job market and accepts wage moderation despite introducing the possibility of growth based on productivity and forgetting that the move from wages to profits did not result in more investment or more jobs
mr president i should like to thank you for visiting the scottish parliament last week
seventythree per cent of those questioned in the 15 member states of the union come down in favour of a european union foreign policy independent of that of the united states
there have been serious breaches in both the uk and the republic of ireland
i would ask them if they are going to administer these funds that they do it efficiently that they do it effectively and that they do it wisely at a time when people need to go to work
that would enhance us as an economic base in terms of the lisbon targets whereas the prevention of development would not
therefore today is a great opportunity for me to clarify some of the misunderstandings
the next item is the council and commission statements on the fifth session of the un human rights council which will take place in geneva on 1119 june 2007
in view of those advances i would ask members to support this compromise package
many acp countries have lost more than seven times the amount they get in development aid
we must join forces to show the way forward for the textiles and clothing sector as a whole
the commission is moreover firmly committed to use all the powers at its disposal to ensure full compliance with ec law
they have played their part in making possible the success that we have achieved and for that i ask that we thank them
the debate is not concerned with objectives as there seems to be a consensus that poverty eradication and sustainable consumption and production are the overriding goals of the summit which as a general feature is further guided by the commitment to achieve the millennium development objectives
however an anniversary is also a time for looking to the future
as i will not have the opportunity to do so later on in the debate i would like to convey my deepest sympathy to all those in new orleans and elsewhere in the united states who have lost relatives friends and indeed belongings as a result of the catastrophe following hurricane katrina
that is why it would be wise to do a kind of final check in the autumn and that it would be very wise following its accession to closely monitor it to ensure that this progress that we have seen is also taking hold although i must say that the sanctions for noncompliance are not very impressive
in addition europe is making substantial general increases in the budget including the provision of eur 5 billion through the recovery plan
i will pass on your appreciation to the person concerned and i am sure that she will sign her latest cd for you mr watson
for us it is important for swedens restrictive drugs policy to continue in the future too
evans report a502292001
thank you for your understanding
this would indeed be in the spirit of enlargement as it would create additional financial facilities for helping the enlarged union to grow closer together
only in that way can we achieve a general awareness which leads to an organisational transformation and a reduction in transport needs
madam president on a point of order
footandmouth disease
the eu institutions and member states should do more to support such schemes
so please do not worry each time the commission carries out its work of analysing the situation on the ground and do not imagine that this work is aimed at removing whatever has been provided until now
at the beginning of the year we were in a position to foresee a large budget deficit for 2003 indicated by all the estimates
nothing was said about venezuela and this is clearly a problem
pursuant to rule 63 of the rules of procedure i have referred this request to the committee on legal affairs and the internal market
as i speak i know that euronews the television channel that seeks to give objective information about all european issues is itself suffering very serious financial difficulties
pt madam president honourable members as i said earlier in developing and negotiating the aforementioned protocol which will result in citizens of developing countries having increased access to drugs at affordable prices the community from a political point of view played a key role
this means that we cannot associate ourselves with any attempt to raise the profile of cabinda s political situation unless the portuguese citizens are released
therefore i hope that parliaments adoption of this report will ensure that the importance of volunteering is acknowledged and that the commission and member states will do all in their power to facilitate and encourage this practice
we either all comply with the rules or we do not
another aspect that i would like to highlight is the ambitious proposal in the field of passengers rights which until now have not been regulated in community law
as the june list does not consider the eu merely to be a form of cooperation for the benefit of increased growth and trade but also as a forum for upholding common fundamental human values we have chosen to vote in favour of the report
if the united nations does not have either the determination or the courage to establish this committee of inquiry it may fall to the european parliament to take the initiative on behalf of our shared values and set up such a committee
this debate also provides the moment to draw together this parliaments examination of the renewed social agenda
puns aside i would in any case like to stress the importance of this document which seeks to help albania regain its proper role in the new europe
fish stocks are a truly natural resource and should be renewable for all time
it has been clear for some time that tougher penalties are needed for both manufacturers and importers to ensure that they take their responsibilities to consumers seriously in this case to defenceless children
however we do not believe that the content of the member states art courses should be determined at eu level
i am glad to be able to tell you that we have indeed made huge progress in this area and i am firmly convinced that we are about to see a real breakthrough
otherwise not only individual areas but also entire valleys in europe will soon be deserted
mrbarroso should be capable of providing the political leadership of a president of the european commission who helped to draw up the constitution and is in favour of it
finally i wish to try to win you over to the amendments that my group has retabled
obviously there are problems within our lawmaking process there are difficulties which we can all recognise and see in our everyday working lives
taking germany as an example i can say that the competition to find the 2010european capital of culture was a wonderful event with 10cities aspiring to be the best
we should preserve the evidence of these crimes
however president obama has not revoked the right of the cia to arrest terrorist suspects on foreign soil and to take them to provisional detention centres
when you think that in 2006 we had practically as many arrest warrants as there were procedures over a 10year period it is clear that the european arrest warrant has been a success
this will make it possible for them to make better use of us
the country of origin principle firmly rooted in this directive is of the utmost importance
these are important issues and i know that there are no simple solutions
moreover there are now already a number of alternatives
author it madam president ladies and gentlemen i should like to draw the commissioners attention to a contradiction to which we risk falling victim
what we in the committee on regional development need for our work is a reliable statement and foundation and both i and my group believe that only the prodi proposal can fulfil that role
applause
one last word mr president ladies and gentlemen to welcome the position taken by the president or so i hope of the next european commission in making the lisbon strategy a priority for his term in office
i received a direct question from mr färm
mr president ladies and gentlemen commissioner bolkestein was right to remind us that the sixth directive on value added tax makes no provision for the payment of vat on postal services
there are also in fact reasons for thanking ourselves here in this chamber because we voted in favour of the much discussed amendment45 which made the victory possible
in addition the recommendation for active improvements in the fleets environmental performance also receives my unqualified support
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
the newlyestablished european commission inherited the preexisting situation of an expanded europe and if you are from one of the new member states you sometimes have the impression here in parliament and also in other european institutions that europe the european union has not fully realised the scale of its expansion yet
moreover this has come at a time when the representatives of all governments institutions and parliaments meeting within the convention are working on the unions new constitutional charter and when the unions now impending enlargement is bringing new opportunities and imposing new responsibilities
to mr dellalba i would say that the aspect of human rights and the inclusion of clauses referring to human rights matters is a standard element
finally it will be a real budget and as mr lamassoure said a moment ago it will be a budget in which it will not be possible for the council to brilliantly decide on new budget lines in a few summits outside of parliament after which the european commission and the european parliament will have to do some financial magic tricks in order to be able to introduce these new and brilliant promises made by the council into the budget
india is two and a half times the size of europe including turkey
the question of coordination of policies arises here and mrs badia i cutchets report proposes an interesting solution the open method of coordination or talking in practical terms the mutual learning of countries from each other based on the examples of those who have managed to solve particular problems in the best way
it is a very important change of direction towards european policies which illustrates the extent of the problem
portuguese citizens confidently expect a significant gesture of support from the citizens of other parts of europe a gesture that should be given material form by europes institutions
we are said to offer too little counterweight to us supremacy
this protocol provides for compensation of greater value than the fishing rights that have been allocated these sums total around eur 43 million and eur 28 million respectively
this is an emphasis that i cannot find in the draft documents before us
i hope the debate will be useful fruitful and influence our votes next week in committee because if it does not we will all have wasted four hours of our time
there is no denial of democracy but a speedingup of all the processes
i agree with your analyses and am sure you will understand that i will not go back over each of the points even though your commitment regarding a defence policy is entirely necessary
this is counterbalanced however by parliaments introduction of the regulation of nanoparticles and thus the application of the precautionary principle
my question to the commission is what has been done since on the outer borders
elections are the beginning of wisdom
in our democratic national systems each time that there is a political discussion even sometimes one that is very polarised we do not call into question the very legitimacy of the state while very often in europe when those of us who are for europe strongly express these objections we have to confront those who are against europe and who explore all sorts of populisms in order to damage our institutions and compromise this great project of peace and solidarity that is the european project
mr president the appalling terrorist attacks that mr savimbi s unita has been carrying out in angola first in caxito then on a train and then on cars schools and hospitals warrant our sternest condemnation because they mainly affect the civilian population
as of spring 2005 the european parliament will be a colegislator in the process necessary to bring this about
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i too am opposed to secondclass eu membership and yes there must be freedom of movement for all workers in the eu and as soon as possible but there are reasons why the option was introduced of using the 232 rule to limit access to national labour markets and it strikes me as pretty risky to attempt to draw from the experiences of three member states conclusions that automatically apply to all the others
the commission also wanted to put in place effective rules on investor disclosure ensuring that anybody wishing to invest its savings into a ucits should receive essential clear and understandable information before taking his or her decision
you have an obligation to vote to choose one of the three films in the competition
the reversal of the duty of care principle which shifts from the public authorities to industry and manufacturers is a phenomenal revolution for the entire sector
nonetheless mr president the fact remains that terrorism today is a real source of conflict from all points of view and can lead to caution within societies and cause them to shut themselves off
it is therefore an original structure and those who say it would be enough to copy the institutions of the nation state are mistaken because the nation state model would not enable us to deal with the problem of the double legitimacy of the member states and of the populations
i should like to address one more fundamental point both the presidentinoffice and the commissioner mentioned the stabilisation and association agreement
europe will make an utter fool of itself
i know that it was the result of hard negotiations in which the rapporteur and the other representatives of the committee on budgets successfully defended the rights of the european parliament
the regional impact of this structural change has been and continues to be at its most severe in the peripheral regions
as far as the nuclear issue is concerned saeed jalili the chief iranian negotiator did not provide the committee on foreign affairs last week with a clear indication of irans real intentions
i thank my colleagues on the committee on budgets for their support and input into this procedure but above all i should like to thank the committee on budgets staff who have enabled all of this to be put together
the commission i believe uses them to fob off responsibility but then interferes arbitrarily in their business in specific cases
nobody is an exception nobody can act as if there were no roma in their own country whether or not they recognise them and then what has been said would not be true of any of the member states of the union without exception
i would invite mr davies to examine what we would be proposing and if he has any specific comments to make i would certainly welcome them
although we fully agree with the rapporteur on certain points in particular on consolidating relations between the uns internal bodies it is inconceivable that the participation of the european union as a full member in the security council and the general assembly of the un would be accepted or along the same lines that the minister for foreign affairs of the european union whose functions are laid down in the draft european constitution should occupy the seat proposed for the eu
turning to commissioner pidla i agree with you both that articles 24 and 25 as they were formulated originally were included with the aim of making it impossible to put up administrative hurdles in the recipient member state
within the european budget itself we produced something like eur 46 billion in this years draft budget
the confidence and trust of citizens consumers and business in the eu itself is linked to their experience and perception of eu laws and the impact they have on their daily lives
mobility is important as stated at the workshop in prague
i fully agree with the rapporteur that what is avoided in all cases is anticipating even for the sake of intergenerational solidarity paradoxical here a reduction in the current levels of public protection
the largest group of christians are citizens belonging to the armenian orthodox church the syrian orthodox church and the roman catholic church
for the vvd the best social policy at european level is the creation of jobs
as regards nonylphenol ethoxylate again we have made substantial progress progress that i regret cannot result in an immediate implementation of complete controls on it
035 of the eus gdp may not be sufficient to achieve our objectives
i hope you will today
snus might not cause lung cancer because it is not inhaled but it has effects and causes problems
it would therefore be premature to prescribe at this early stage how mountain regions are to be taken into account in the forthcoming 20072013 planning period for regional policy
as incidentally i also did in a still unanswered letter i wrote together with my fellow mep mrs kauppi from finland i would most strongly urge commissioner lamy to initiate a wto procedure against south korea straight away
this is not an issue that can be simply ignored
the draft budget is moderate
the report has however retained a number of positive points such as the need to impose extremely severe penalties on companies using cheap labour supplied through human trafficking or the need for member states to accept responsibility for the victims of trafficking in human beings in addition to effectively clamping down on the laundering of the proceeds of the traffic in human beings
the commissions behaviour which i have praised is not always mirrored in many of the member states and in the european parliament there are conflicting positions some which are in favour of resolving this problem and some which are not
the president cut off the speaker
we expect specific commitments and specific proposals from the european commission in this direction when it presents its programme next january
right now i have no desire to go through everything that has happened in relation to it in the past
so let us wait a little
if so did the commission attempt any publicity initiatives to mitigate this
they are natures top dog when it comes to pollination and without them we can say goodbye to soya beans onions carrots broccoli apples oranges avocados peaches and many other foods
i believe that the union must act decisively
there are some problems that are general to all the agencies
i hope that the whole of the commission and the council too will echo this and will support commissioner kovcs efforts on this subject
we are talking about the proposals relating to the security of supply of oilbased products and the supply of natural gas
however mr cohnbendit we need to be careful not to plunder the elites of the developing world
what happens if it then results in a serious incident closing a major port
while offering you cooperation we also urge you to take seriously the advice that the socialist group in this house has given you
no
it can be bridged only slowly by the development of european citizenship in an honest fair and just way
the report reached two conclusions
i said last night in one of the debates that we are in a week when there is a lot of soulsearching in the european union about what the idea of europe is for and how we can reengage with our citizens and really show the people of europe that we are doing a worthwhile job and protecting them their families and their interests
the new proposal with regard to marketing authorisations for medicines extends a helping hand to the pharmaceuticals industry
why was there some opposition to this constitutional treaty
as to the our legal order significant progress has been achieved and most of the areas are unproblematic provided that the current pace of preparations is maintained
regarding the implementation of the new eu drugs action plan the conclusion can be drawn that progress has been made on nearly all specific objectives and actions with varying degrees of success
this is the first year of the 20072013 financial perspective which we have been involved in drawing up and which thus fully applies to us
yet i have to say to you yes it can
the euro is an historic achievement
it is not that simple but i will try my hand at it in any case
let us tell you that we also want parliament to participate in the control procedure and wish to be kept informed about your activities
the outcome for the czech republic would be that by the year 2013 it would become one of the states with the largest share part of the speech could not be heard transferred within the framework of modulation from the first to the second pillar
this initial sixmonth ban has been extended on a rolling basis ever since despite a categorical commission announcement in 2004 that there was no risk of tse occurrence let alone transmission from fishmeal fed to ruminants and that the policy of zero tolerance of meat and bone spicules in animal feed should be lifted
i voted against the motion on echelon because in my view
the directive on services is a case in point
lithuanias experience of reforms shows that if a favourable environment is not created for the transfer of capital and labour from less efficient to more productive activities ie a liberal window of new opportunities is not opened for the population or business social expenditure on structural reforms is very great and the results due to great opposition do not match expectations
three problems have become clear however and i should like to hear commissioner solbes mira s position on them
the french presidency should also support the common agricultural policy enabling european farmers to produce more
in this connection i believe we can agree to this proposal with a large majority without more ado
so let us not condemn those who defend this point of view but let us call on the entire european community be it the commission the european parliament or the member states to reiterate just how important human rights and the law itself are in this very sensitive area
i call on the member states of the european union who want to take a more active line to step up their collaboration even before the treaty of nice takes effect and to remind france and the rest that they are surely backing the wrong horse in taking this de facto passive line
it may well be a very good constitution
we have also managed to provide support for the safe closure of the kozloduy nuclear power plant in bulgaria and i would particularly like to emphasise the safe aspect in this matter
may i ask the commission why is it taking so long
4
amendment nos 5 and 47 deal with the important issue of capacity development in developing countries but contain no mechanisms for putting this into practice
measures of an economic nature which we would support first of all include the need to define a european macroeconomic policy which is outwardlooking and competitive
poland for example has some 100 000 people employed by poczta polska which is incapable of facing open competition in the medium term
that would indeed become an even bigger problem
important points such as unpaid and voluntary donations reference to fundamental ethical principles and the request for a directive applying also to organs have been brushed off the table
it is therefore up to the member states to correct this institutional and political anomaly
we should therefore draw political conclusions and seek solutions at this level we should monitor the activities of these services subject them to legal and parliamentary scrutiny adopt uniform rules to protect citizens at the highest national level and apply this throughout the european union
we might well have had more use for the ombudsman in relation to a case in britain in which lloyds cheated thousands of people an event which led to a long list of tragedies in the form of suicides and much else besides
to them i would reply that the allies had the right to occupy germany
now this directive is more about openness and the protection of minority shareholders and less about takeover rules
mr leinen there is therefore a wide range of tools being put in place
i believe that agreements will be reached both on the longterm objective where there is general consensus and on the midterm objectives given that these agreements are essential in order to achieve the desired outcome in 2009 in copenhagen
however now it would appear that there is hope for better things to come
i am convinced that todays debate will give parliament and the commission the opportunity to touch upon many important subjects relating to the 2003 budget
three solutions are then possible
supermario as he has been labelled in the media has taken the lead and not only in pressing for radical reform in europe
however i believe we are moving in the right direction before the problem becomes unmanageable
not democracy
if the commission gives up its monopoly on exemptions in the future this will not reform competition law it will merely change the system
i can say categorically that the vast majority of these cases have been processed fully and properly by the spanish authorities and by the families in question
that is the first thing it has to do
we are all aware that in a great many cases levels of implementation and compliance are far from ideal
however the amendment to the trips agreement was the result of lengthy and laborious negotiations within the framework of the wto
therefore we members of the european parliament must support the development of independent media and fair competition at national level
it is also worth considering one additional issue the consumption of alcohol and alcohol dependence especially in young people goes hand in hand with other addictions which combine and often lead to tragedy
one extremely important principle was referred to in both the presidency and the commission statements namely the principle of support for society
to conclude that is why i think it is important to endow this programme with more substantial more adequate funding
if sufficient financial resources are not available for these objectives then the initiative will remain a dead letter
the main reason why they do so is that the old directive is unworkable and in environmental terms prehistoric
the eu will continue to follow the developments in this area
furthermore the inhabitants of the newlyintegrated countries are considered to be second class citizens who for a long transitional period will not have the same rights as other members in particular that of settling or working wherever they wish
in writing pl multilingualism in the european union is a great attribute in contacts with third countries
he recommends sending a force to operate between the two parties this proposal was immediately rejected by sharons government as israel does not have any borders and as long as israel does not accept its own borders there will be absolutely no chance of any peace plan starting or succeeding
mr désir i answered you regarding standards in the labour market
thanks to the preparatory work it has done the commission has brought the mobile operators to take this initiative because the mobile operators understood very well that the commission would not stand still and not do anything
although there are many different aspects to this issue i should like to highlight two that i believe are particularly important
the inflationary increase is 31 based on eurostat data and the harmonised index of consumer prices
all people know perfectly well what this disease is and that it must be combated
finally i want to support mrs pletinsks call for clauses concerning the blind and visually handicapped to be reinstated in the proposed directive
that is clearly the opposite of what we want to do here and therefore i urge you to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by the pse and my group
i believe that on the contrary we are sources of mutual strength
we believe that the liberalisation of the market will not change this and that international obligations will continue to be met in full
i do not intend to dwell on the details of individual issues but i am willing to take your questions and look forward with interest to the rest of the debate
the european union is founded on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms based on article 6 of the treaty and the eu charter of fundamental rights
presidentinoffice of the council the answer to the first question by the honourable member is yes particularly because we need to discuss these issues
on the car industrys obligation to make more efficient engines and more efficient cars we will follow that path as well
the member states did not need the accident that befell the prestige to make that clear to them
we need to revise the military strategy we need to bring all the different initiatives together
i do not therefore agree with amendment 3 by mr florenz asking for limited exceptions
is there anyone in latvia who wants to return to a europe where there are customs barriers between nations
what is very important and it is clearly also important to you to judge by your questions is the fact that the commission notes that once negotiations have started with turkey the political criteria will continue to be monitored very closely
mr barros moura was a member of this parliament from 1986 to 1989 and then again from 1994 to 1999 in the group of the party of european socialists
the first reactions as i have followed them in this house have broadly endorsed the result of the convention
i think it is a good report
they also noted that combating illegal immigration requires a greater effort on the part of the european union with the use of all appropriate instruments in the context of the european unions external relations
but the problem with regulation 17 was not its creation or the rules it established at the time of its creation
mercosur appears still to hope that the free trade area of the americas will come to pass even though the usa has little appetite for it preferring instead advantageous bilateral deals with individual latin american republics as it already has a very successful and cosy setup in nafta with mexico and canada
i remember the resolution passed in spring last year in which we clearly stated that the second tranche was linked to very clear precise considerations as to how measures to guarantee the ability of the european union to act during the course of the enlargement process could be prepared while retaining the substance of the acquis communautaire
the next item is the commission statement on natural disasters fires and floods
on the contrary if the single currency did not exist the adverse effects of the crisis would be much greater
this is the right way to get tangible answers
after all the african unions headquarters are in ethiopia
moreover i believe that the charter of fundamental rights which we have signed today enshrines the true nature of our civilisation and not the integrismo of those who came here today to oppose it an attitude which is regrettable and violent
we do not therefore wish to bring grist to the mill of those who as it were want to see the back of this scheme
i would like to highlight what i believe to be the most relevant of the comments received
this is something we should welcome and we should spread the news
thank you very much and i wish you every success in your new role
as for the goepel report regrettably i am not able to extend the same congratulations because this is an eminently political matter and we must use political arguments to discuss it
it is very difficult for the swedish presidency to determine exactly when a violation takes place and when not
first mr smidt has not departed he is still the directorgeneral of the fisheries dg
at the same time though it has to be said that this orange revolution has not managed to bridge the huge divisions in ukraine and there is as yet no consensus on the course that the country should take
in writing the eu must get behind the mdg wholeheartedly but i voted against the report on the mdg because once again colleagues have advocated sexual reproductive rights in the report
it must also provide scope for improved decisionmaking
the reason is simple
this is the first step in an ongoing project to improve the quality and the presentation of information concerning proceedings in the plenary both for members and the public
any old words are being used and i have the impression that a political definition is virtually being avoided
people are thinking about it and i expect the commission is too the ministry of economy in berlin has now made a study of the pros and cons of these issues
on the other hand it would be extremely cynical to reproach workers organisations for not including women in their number when female workers throughout the european union have the problem of insufficient or nonexistent crèches and nursery schools
it is an omission that this value should be given such scant attention in this report
they should not prolong the suffering of the iraqi people
we all know that the consequences of a slowdown of stagnation and in some countries such as portugal of economic recession are rising unemployment and social exclusion
of course the matter of fingerprinting is something which i believe goes beyond the pale
in the same way eu investment is needed for the protection of nature in the northern seas
i would like to know how it is possible for these invitations to have been distributed and who brought them to the european parliament
whether it is a matter of better regulation or of lawmaking what is important is the way in which the initiative for the law is taken
i would also like to mention the intelligent energy projects and support for lifelong learning
applause
further discussions related to questions about regulation versus stimulus measures
why have we not made progress with the usa on regulatory issues between the eu and the us by completing the transatlantic single market
i am dealing with this case with great care
in order to demonstrate that the european parliament is inflexible on this point we are presenting some amendments which put certain appropriations in reserve
in the netherlands this is used to buy nature areas
mr president as coordinator for the ppede group i would like to stress the following points
madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the financial preconditions for market access for airlines have of course already been discussed in the committee on transport and tourism
it is true that at the start the council was not unanimous on the principle or then on the amounts

pl mr president commissioner my colleague mr liberadzki and i submitted an amendment to this report
we now have the opportunity to make practical improvements to the conditions experienced by these animals
this project also encourages citizens to become culturally involved and to familiarise themselves with culture in all its dimensions
indeed it is a rare budget when we find that we do not yet have some of the programmes in place because the multiannual programmes are in the process now of being completed as let us hope the financial regulation will be in place for the beginning of next year to be the basis for our operation
the commission will scrupulously respect the priorities adopted by the european parliament at the vote on the budget and has no intention of modifying the balance in terms of either the detail or the broader picture of the prince programme as adopted by the budgetary authority
it is also the centre of certainly the british cultural industries
amendments nos 16 and 17 seek to curb the role of the commission by preventing it from using external expertise as well as technical and administrative assistance
this covers energy motorways highspeed rail links waterways universities education broadband health space and so on
i am sorry that provision has not been included for the creation of a european regulatory mechanism
since nat plays the policeman where it is inconvenient for us let us call on it to do so to suit our needs

i would like it to be recorded in the minutes at least then that i also wanted to speak about this report on air transport
new jobs and more employment must be created otherwise the result is all talk and no action
i think there are two good reasons for highlighting this work for one thing it has been a mammoth task but i also think that mr schmid can justifiably be commended specifically for not having succumbed to what might be referred to as sensationalism
according to the oecd us agricultural policy costs usd 338 per taxpayer in comparison with usd 276 in the european union
i am extremely grateful to parliaments committee on legal affairs and the internal market and particularly to the rapporteur lord inglewood here represented by mr harbour for their efficient handling of this matter
ladies and gentlemen imagine a situation in which a number of players are recruited to join a football team
it was actually a gallantry due to the fact that it was the last speech of the evening except for the reply by our rapporteur mr onesta whose turn it is to speak now
the development in technologies can bring protection against surveillance
i reckon i have spoken to between 300 and 400 members

when we introduced information technology in 1995 i could not have imagined that this subject would cause a stir in the european parliament
i have also noted carefully what was said regarding the representation of the eu in the security council
i know commissioner that you mentioned the decisions taken by the commission to fight trafficking in human beings but we are by no means convinced that these decisions and the guidelines which you have issued will soon be transposed into the legislation of the member states and we know that without judicial and without police cooperation that is without paneuropean collaboration it is impossible to break up these gangs
we have the lowest proportion of smokers anywhere in europe we have the lowest proportion of all tobaccorelated illnesses anywhere in europe but do you know what

personally as rapporteur of the committee with competence in the matter i have never been consulted by any of the other committees had it been an enhanced hughes procedure which it is not i would have had to be consulted
i voted for the draft european parliament resolution on multilingualism an asset for europe and a shared commitment because i believe that cultural and linguistic diversity within the european union is a treasure which makes an effective contribution to unity in diversity

more minors are likely to be executed shortly in iran
pl mr president promoting an active and conscious role for citizens in society is one of the main principles held by the european socialist family

on justice and home affairs we will focus on the implementation of measures like the european arrest warrant
as you know in accordance with articles 149 and 150 of the ec treaty responsibility for the content and organisation of education and training systems rests with the member states

so the stakes are high
the socialist group in the european parliament rejects the commissions narrow focus on individual labour law

without truth there can be no reconciliation
in general terms it is a onesided indictment of israel
i want to conclude with the possibilities that will be available within state aid schemes

mr president last week was the 16th anniversary of the end of the division of germany
it also enhances the role of our parliament as a control body and a democratic expression of the european union and therefore also enhances the democratic legitimacy of our common project and better defines the political responsibility of the commission
as the presidency has already stressed in the morning debate this issue will be discussed also at the meeting of the european council beginning tomorrow
of course if no one has anything to say there is no point in continuing the debate but when there is too little time available as was the case with the topical and urgent debate here there really is no reason why the full amount of time until 630 pm cannot be used especially as the people who are here now will also be here tomorrow and the others have already left anyway
i was about to say minister as i remember you from your days as french minister for european integration

i welcome irelands recent commitment as one of the 15 eu member states to launch a national action plan on fgm
lastly i note that some directives are being revised for the seventh time whereas others such as directive 79409 eec have never been revised before
i tabled amendments to that end but as these amendments have not been adopted i have voted against the report
we simply opted to strengthen coordination in this scenario
that is refreshing for this house and also the idea of turning the presidency into an electoral campaign is something quite new
cooperation between national states is bypassed with the creation of mechanisms for supranational control over these states
as we know the member states have very different legislative solutions as regards the rights and obligations arising from samesex partnerships
let us therefore work together in order to achieve this
it mr president ladies and gentlemen congratulations on this new form of democracy
this is central to ensuring that we get started now and do not suddenly find ourselves with unfulfilled targets in 2020
madam president i am sorry that i keep on having to repeat myself on the subject of wednesdays but the same deplorable state of affairs still exists
we need better information in advance more effort on inspection and supporting whistleblowers and greater clarity about peoples rights so we do not see the exploitation that mrcottigny has referred to which threatens to undercut working conditions and exploits individuals
i would like to move away from the text for a moment to say that i can assure you that this issue is always on the agenda in all the political dialogues that we hold with developing countries
that is the reasonable order
i really believe that all this is paving the way for a good stockholm programme and i would like to thank parliament for that
what then are we to say to third countries
that is why we have to come back to the issue

rapporteur pt while thanking you for your words i would also point out that according to the provisions of the treaties measures to support the outermost regions are possible and desirable

i am thinking in particular of oscar espinosa chepe who is today hospitalised in the prison ward of the finlay military hospital in havana seriously ill as the result of chronic cirrhosis of the liver from which he suffered at the time of his arrest and which has been aggravated by his weakness and the bad prison conditions and hygiene to which he has been subjected
fourthly it improves passengers rights which is very important the right to full information on the actual price of a ticket including taxes charges and fees and the right not to be discriminated against on grounds of nationality or residence when purchasing a ticket

ladies and gentlemen i would like in particular to draw your attention to tomorrows vote
privacy is a fundamental right
the cost of the war and the subsequent cost of the peace will be a heavy burden for the economy of the world
i only say this to illustrate the relative nature of the figures
if we do that and if there is then special monitoring in other words a precise period of observation then i am sure that both countries will now take the necessary steps and really will be able to join on 1january 2007
as one who works in the field of development policy i should also like to say that i keenly await the commissions proposals as to how more projects in the framework of the clean development mechanism can be taken to the poorest countries of our planet for we all know that the poorest countries suffer most from the effects of climate change

it is about achieving a balanced relationship between open access to the internet and the protection of intellectual property and here we do indeed still have a large number of tasks to resolve and instruments to find that take account of both objectives
however over and above these general policies every country needs to reform the system itself which has been inherited from a previous era of industrial development
in my view this is not permissive dialogue which is an alternative to forms of political condemnation but it fully involves civil society including ngos and figures from the academic world who are active in the field of human rights and it is based on the pursuit of precise goals whose implementation is monitored carefully and regularly
first a commission communication on the stability and growth pact second a court ruling on the excessive deficit procedure with reference to germany and france and third a statement by the european council on the stability and growth pact
we find it doubtful that group pressure has any positive effect on the way member states behave on the contrary there will be even more political chumminess of the you scratch my back and ill scratch yours variety

for the commission the main objective of a proactive information and communication strategy has to be to improve the perception that the public has of the european union in essence it should improve the publics awareness of the european dimension of their citizenship

through the implementation of the measures proposed in it justice will have more instruments for guaranteeing the fundamental freedoms that formed the basis for the construction of europe and which have been restricted by terrorism for thousands of europeans
i told the ministers that i intended to follow what the european parliament had agreed in the main areas
i agree with you commissioner that if we manage to save even one single life on the roads then we have achieved something you see i believe that the most important thing we can do as european decisionmakers is to protect human lives
looking back i am convinced that our decision to consult the committee of european securities regulators on these issues was the right one
please propose solutions that put an end to the problems of the operational programmes and funds the excessive bureaucracy and the harmful consequences of trade agreements with third countries
that is why we also have the interinstitutional agreement of 1999
i refer to the echelon debate of this morning
as my party has already highlighted in an amendment contributing this knowhow results in increased economic activity which promotes a considerable diversification of products
a second step must then be to increase value added through exports
thank you for your attention
that was the proposal made by the committee on budgets and that is what we must examine today and in the weeks to come by prioritising the most effective policies for attaining these objectives and thus for achieving the worlds most powerful knowledgebased economy
it does seem essential however to launch an indepth debate on the subject of appropriate values of biomass reference points adjusted to the actual state of the stocks and the current general situation of the baltic sea ecosystem
argentina also objects to the confusion over the brazilian initiative last december to create a south american community of nations which was important recently in supporting brazils role in stabilising ecuador as argentina believes that mercosur needs to be reinforced before that happens
once again i wish you a very warm welcome
not only was the chinese government ready to assist the island but also private companies and organisations of different kinds including the association for relations across the taiwan straits and the mainland red cross society
we have seen in the past that north korea can be open to limited but mutually fruitful economic cooperation with its neighbours and other partners
furthermore it needs to be made very clear that these protocols also have to be supported by the member states at council level as the council is responsible for signing and ratifying them on behalf of the community
eccanada agreement on cooperation in the fields of higher education training and youth vote
the next item is the statements by the council and the commission on the situation in the middle east
in writing todays debate creates a new favourable environment to encourage a wider social debate on the role nuclear energy will play in europe in the future
this is yet another exercise in avoiding doing anything whilst at the same time very practical preparations are going ahead in other areas
this was particularly important during the greek presidency given that inter alia that period marked the final phase of the work of the convention culminating in the presentation of the eu draft constitutional treaty to the thessaloniki european council
the matter will be reported to the president and the appropriate authorities will be asked to take action
a wider application of community competition rules by the relevant authorities in the context of a network of close cooperation will in itself represent a great step forward in ensuring predictability as compared with the present situation in which sixteen competition authorities apply different rules

in recent years however some backwards steps have been taken particularly in relation to energy and the recent commission proposals have not lived up to expectations
this will enable us to try and minimise the procedural delay which the data protection directive has incurred as compared with the rest of the package
the european arrest warrant has really delivered significant results
depositguarantee schemes as regards the coverage level and the payout delay
i regret this specifically because in the constitutional treaty we prepared a very good transparent regulatory framework which offers us another opportunity to speed up the process of the ratification of the constitutional treaty
on the voting list today we have the vote on the principle of subsidiarity
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen my group endorses this owninitiative motion and also the question to the commission to which a clear answer has been given and i hope that this common strategy will enable us to make headway
that is what the commission proposed and what this house and subsequently the council adopted which is definitely progress
i think that the european union should make its attitude clearer
they want the subsidiarity principle to be strengthened
i welcome the endorsement by the european council of the commissions idea of a political declaration to be adopted in berlin on 25march 2007
i hope that this house will support the proposal
the decision also takes account of the need to maintain continuity in the european parliaments legislative work
greece is preparing for local and regional elections and absolutely noone has highlighted the part which local agencies can play in creating jobs
before the vote on paragraph 3
the second thing and it is something i see as very important is the energy issue
in order to exchange mutual experiences it is important that contacts between ourselves and colleagues from candidate countries are intensified
the answer to that question is very much contained in this report
in particular will the commission investigate the contribution to the nondelivery of the single electricity market of the failure adequately to address the dominance of the esb in the southern market and the resulting lack of competition which of course is the imperative to success in any single electricity market
specialists are discussing possible operations in iraq sudan and the congo
how and by means of what measures does the commission intend to deal with the current crisis which is now damaging the development of the national economies and reducing household incomes leading the public at large to call into question the role of the euro in relation to the price of oil
the drugs strategy has been mentioned and questions have been asked about it
i want to make a second important point about internal market strategy
a clear expression of the balance to which i refer and which is absent from the text of the report would be fundamental in encouraging a change in behaviour and attitudes on the part of firms and workers with a view to encouraging confidence levels
that is the only thing we were working on
in bavaria therefore beer is a basic foodstuff
approximately 100140 million women and girls worldwide have undergone the practice while 4 million are potentially at risk
i of course support the amendment calling for the provisions of the doha declaration on medicines to be implemented especially as the agreement that the trips council has just reached is supposed to allow it to come into force
i think we certainly have to approve the text but i would ask the commission to make sure that the aim of creating an open market in postal services is not circumvented by measures taken by the member states
i should like to thank all those who helped to achieve it my fellow members of the european parliament and particularly brian simpson with whom a 14year friendship was forged by our joint efforts in the realm of postal services
a lack of vets and no epidemic monitoring which is why the disease spread
there you are you see wandering from one place to another i have been useful i have seen an area where you as europe might be able to do something to enhance the environment
however having said that i must admit that i am suspicious of a certain utilitarian philosophy which tends to affirm that the ends justify the means and that ultimately we should just let the operators get on with it and the market will sort it all out
having left behind the rationale of yalta and power blocs we must make the case for increasing multilateralism
as you can see the council has ensured that its draft budget adequately covers the priorities within the internal policy of category 3 of the financial perspectives
just like commissioner bolkestein i think that this impact should be countered by the option of being able to claim back the vat or by special tax rates
however we also need measures to clamp down on speculation which do not exist as yet and a twoway adjustment of retail prices and production costs
there are also concerns that the polling stations set up in the russian federation will be very hard to monitor independently
mr president i would like to congratulate the commission because i have the impression from its answers to various questions that in relation to the spanish national hydrological plan it has so far been able to distinguish between the technical and the legal problems
we are all familiar with the system of compulsory education and i believe that language and literacy and numeracy skills quite simply things that are necessary for a good life should be made compulsory
what regulatory impact assessments do is give us support we are informed of the consequences our actions will have by independent people too
it should motivate all member states to carry out the necessary institutional reforms
as regards the first issue concerning a possible project between hungary and slovakia if such a project is submitted to the european commission we will certainly give it our utmost attention
this is the time for you commissioner here in parliament in the absence of the president of the commission formally to tell us in your opinion the level of resources europe needs in order to fulfil its ambitions
i can only strongly support the inclusion of bulgaria and romania in the programme giving way to the interest expressed by the two potential new member states to take part in this action given the symbolic importance of making them already feel a part of europe and in order to further enrich our cultural values and diversity
i repeat climate changes are extremely important and this region plays an important role
i am thinking most of all of the small and mediumsized businesses that send their workers on transborder activities
that is to say even if a private document is notarised in a country where authentic acts do not exist it cannot have the enforceable value that notarial acts in continental law have since the latter have a binding enforceable value that is completely different
mr president eight months have passed since i had the pleasure of addressing you on the commissions proposal for a directive establishing quality and safety requirements for human tissues and cells
above all however we cannot forget that it requires us to exploit fisheries and promote the development of foodproducing agriculture on a sustainable model
both in delhi and in madrid the eu troika has raised our concerns about the crisis with the government of india and the commission has participated in these démarches
finally i was not in johannesburg and so i do not know whether you also represented us but commissioner was it not made clear to us there all the time that export refunds of this sort this kind of agricultural policy this type of subsidy ends up making a massive contribution to the great misery to be found in many parts of the world
furthermore the directive will sit well with the sustainability agenda which would demand that the cleanest of vehicles possible always be required
i back the clear condemnation and deplore the fact that in 45 years the burmese regime has made no progress on respect for human rights and freedom of conscience
in recent years we have on several occasions found the solution to necessary changes in the economic and political environment by using reallocation repeated squeezing of margins and multiple revisions
it took place in the parliament building and it allowed the organisers to gain credit and our approval for what they said
europe needs people willing to work today and increasingly so in the years to come
this level of traceability does not exist in brazil and this is unacceptable from an eu point of view
in this it will certainly be supported even though unfortunately our legislative powers do not exist in this area
in reality that form of words in their amendments merely echoes what is already in the information and consultation directive
we need the treaty of lisbon for greater democracy so that the european union has more freedom of action and for greater transparency
let me now turn to the subject of the citizens europe and the constitutional debate itself
i propose that the sitting be suspended until the votes are taken
it is however quite right that the european parliament should feel concern for a case that has already cost the lives of a about thousand people or even more as estimates vary according to the source
this has to happen because you need a diversion
this system of diagonal cumulation of origin will allow economic operators in the euromed area as a whole to expand their potential sources of supply by allowing producers in that area which will be unified from this point of view to use intermediate products from the whole of the area without any barriers
the captain was given permission to proceed to the indonesian port of merak after which he was put under duress by the passengers with threatened suicides and forced to sail towards australian waters
the eu in this way is still a creation of the cold war merely searching for its identity and role in the world
they rely on kozloduj for some of their power supplies
as we said to the israeli foreign minister yesterday when she met with the committee on foreign affairs we understand the extreme concern felt by this house about the humiliation and frustration that the people of palestine are suffering
the draft now before you is something we regard as an acceptable compromise
all this is part of our agreements and of straightforward cooperation between institutions
we have tabled an amendment which is designed to point a way forward here and i ask for your support
the opportunities for mobility have had the totally opposite effect for them making discrimination worse
i believe however that too much exactitude and too many details can also be dangerous and with this in mind i can only support what was said by mrs thyssen here and also in our work generally we should distinguish more and more between political statements and technical considerations
they will in particular be monitored by those bodies that have been established pursuant to the europa agreement namely the association council the association committee and the subcommittees
we cannot have a directive that says nothing about genetically modified organisms and the damage which their free use may cause or which makes no reference to the damage caused by shipping or the use of nuclear energy
i have read that you want to organise a major round of talks with ministers which will then achieve a breakthrough
within the framework of meda s technical and financial aid to algeria the eu supports a project for modernising the police force
we need clarity in the budget so that we know which institutions agencies and funds receive money from us and which do not
the profits were cashed in while the losses have now been nationalised
i do not want to prolong the discussion ahead
mr presidentinoffice of the council you have not really been very explicit because all you are telling me is that proposals will be presented during the second half of 2003 but without being specific about them
we may have been right to oppose the war but we did not come up with any alternative way of getting rid of saddam hussein
madam president as well as thanking the commissioner for what he has just said i would like to ask the presidency in order to reinforce the gesture we have made by means of this debate to allow us to vote on the watson report first not last as is currently planned
this brings us to a third and particularly useful conclusion which is that there is no such thing as insurance policy per se or insurance policy as an isolated problem and that within the framework of a horizontal approach it is a necessary aspect of other policies especially tax policy employment policy and policies to combat discrimination and exclusion
applause
first of all there is a need to improve communications and information on the activities of our institutions at a local level and we should therefore promote information campaigns debates and talks on major european topics
we have all spent many hours talking about european citizenship and it is time to realise that that citizenship applies to all irrespective of race
applause
mr president i shall begin by responding to mr deprez who is an expert in budgetary matters justice and home affairs
there is a question of economic credibility at play here
nevertheless there are some aspects that we proposed but were not accepted
the debate is closed
we need to do something about it
growth employment competitiveness
he is a socialist i am not
it is not always easy
of course we have access to such figures and it is pleasing in my view that levels of emissions from new european passenger cars are far far below the average for passenger cars in other parts of the world
that is what the european union is for
then mr barnier will speak on behalf of the commission
every day 8000 young people are infected with hiv
in future not only must we prevent these forms of positive discrimination but since we have committed ourselves to an egalitarian agricultural policy then the regulation of rural development should not be permitted to rely on exceptions
i believe that it is a compromise that is worthy of our support a compromise that honours the original written declaration and honours the views of european citizens
mr president i too would like to congratulate mr maaten on his work
i therefore say that creating more jobs in europe will depend largely on what happens in the regions
ireland fully meets the legal commitments under the multiannual guidance programmes
last but not least the commission will submit a proposal at the beginning of next year for a new post2010 growth and employment strategy
its tries to block the admission of refugees who are in danger and on the contrary we try to help those victims of suppression catastrophes and poverty
i call on the commission to urgently adopt specific measures aimed at supporting people with disabilities
i therefore abstained for these two reasons
the council and parliament are the two arms of the budget authority and must respect each other in that
this scheme would be dealt with and coordinated by the eu thus ensuring regional arbitrariness
it also needs to demonstrate clear evidence of results in the fight against corruption in terms of investigations and judicial proceedings
however in two areas such a position seems neither entirely wise nor realistic
counterterrorism instruments or policies which do not respect fundamental rights often play into the hands of the terrorists themselves
i recently visited the camp myself and i assure you that the allegations included in the amendments tabled are absolutely unfounded
we can see how inadequate the commissions departments are they have neither sufficient resources nor the political will to apply community law in the most obvious of cases
if we are slow in changing the energy sector then not only will we suffer but also the next generations will suffer
this is after all the government of the country on whose territory mrs haidar is currently to be found
today in this house agricultural and fisheries policy was discussed and we noticed that integrating environmental issues with these important matters appears to be very difficult in practice
the commission communication gives us a sense of a change towards more ambitious strategies and objectives that are more in keeping with what the european union should represent on the international stage and parliament agrees perhaps in even stronger terms with the direction advocated by the commission
i myself have submitted an amendment which i will commend to the house on thursday
i should also like to say however that the purpose of introducing resale rights is to enable practitioners of the visual arts to benefit from the subsequent financial success of their works
as i believe that here in the main the vast majority of meps are europeans they are aware of the gravity of the situation
does this reservation imply that sweden is exempt from any eu rules which may restrict the application of the national principle of public access to official documents
entry into force of the ban on a date earlier than that desired by the commission that is to say 2010 instead of 2011
in particular we feel that the united nations should play an increasingly central role further consolidating its mandate in this difficult postcombat phase
there you have the small digression that i wanted to make madam president
we need to put an end to all forms of discrimination
i also however deplore the challenging behaviour of saddam hussein who has continually managed to ignore the un resolutions
we are concerned about it as we should be
i would remind the house of a report by the temporary committee on improving safety at sea chaired by mr jarzembowski in which we made it clear that although the regulatory framework was in place at both european and international level we still had to ensure practical application and followup of those rules by people on board ships in ports and elsewhere in order to ensure that shipping was as safe as possible
in my opinion that is what is still lacking
it would not be easy to mix everything together and to try to resolve all the issues facing the european union by 2004
it is well known that something that you give but which cannot be disposed of has little value to the receivers since they have made no effort to get it
it is also significant that recitals r and s state that measures must have restrictions on the part of states so that there is no abuse of the legal regulations
this presentation is therefore an emotional occasion but also a realistic one because i stand here before you both in order to present and assess what we have accomplished and also to reiterate what remains to be done to ensure that europe gains a real constitution
that is why the commission has also provided for traffic avoidance actions
i believe that both parties will have to make great efforts to achieve this
paragraph 1 stipulates that the ecb has the exclusive right to authorise the issue of bank notes
mr president ladies and gentlemen my group does of course wish to give robert mccartneys sisters a very warm welcome to the european parliament
ordinary people are literally running after the money as the prizes are getting higher
commissioner please undertake the necessary reforms that will provide real and unequivocal support for fruit and vegetable producers organisations
given the relatively low attendance in this house on thursdays i make no comment about why that is it is quite unacceptable for a major codecision text of this kind to be taken on a thursday
as regards measures for which organisations of market operators can claim a grant the commission is prepared to examine the inclusion of table olives and the assurance of origin
thirdly humanising the debate about the victims who are people who are suffering and need to be protected defended recognised helped and supported
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen this proposal for a directive has set ambitious aims for itself to protect health and the environment
i am very concerned at the current lack of sufficient data to carry out a scientific assessment of the state of our deepsea fish stocks
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday 7 july 2005
we need to bear that in mind at this point
it is not yet altogether straightforward to pass final judgment on the elements of this new process but one thing can be said today albeit with a great deal of caution and that is that the member states have in their national reform programmes basically allowed themselves to be guided by the priorities set out in the integrated economic guidelines as has the commission with its proposal for a community action programme
as part of the copenhagen conference i would like to call for particular attention to be focused as well on adaptation measures as we will continually have to deal with powerful storms flooding prolonged drought or forest fires
those involved in public procurement ought to consider the longterm benefits
i believe that the new approaches in the field of community competition law not only constitute an enormous effort to modernise that community law but also an effort in the right direction
we need a european approach in order to promote this mode of transport
an old romanian proverb says you can run but you cannot hide
i am very glad that the commission accepts this
returning to the report i think that the most important result we have achieved is that by starting this european financing we are better able to ensure the improved operation of the internal market and clean competition for each market player and interested party also we have managed to achieve this without creating too much bureaucracy or god forbid a new institution which we are so keen on doing
one of the problems that i had with the proposal initially was that it seemed to want to codify or create a tariff of protection
the social agenda cannot be separated from a renewed lisbon strategy because economic success sustains social benefits and social benefits also contribute to economic success
mr president mr presidentinoffice of the council commissioner i warmly congratulate you
regarding these organisations i would like to say the following i hope that this part of the programme that deals with active remembrance will help us adhere to its original purpose of supporting memorial sites to the victims of nazism and stalinism because the impact of these totalitarian regimes was a europeanwide one and was not limited to a single country

our fellow citizens would not understand if we were to backtrack
what a negative message it sends to the many more who are in fear of losing their jobs
in terms of the construction of europe the role of sport was formally recognised by the communities in the adonino report presented to the milan european council in june 1985
we have got to act and we have got to act now
the european court of justice will lose its legitimacy as a result of the arrogant attitude it displays towards the popularly elected governments of the member states
so having chopped it in two and taken the highly dubious step of dividing the regulation between two legal bases the main thrust being environment with some ancillary provisions grounded on the single market legal base the council handed the baton back to parliament
the programme will be operational by 2003 and will last until 2010
due to their very nature some functions of big city centres cannot be transferred to rural areas
some members of this house preferred to take a national tack and settle domestic national accounts but it is good that that strategy failed as it would have risked nipping the debate in the bud
our abstention expresses our opposition to the master and slave relationship that the european union is seeking to impose on these countries in collaboration with their privileged classes in addition to the antiworker policy imposed under the pretext of enlargement
they can also involve hazards to human health and to the environment
moreover we should not hamper bilateral agreements that open up the market more quickly
we have succeeded in providing the financial resources that were needed for the construction of 12 demonstration projects across europe
these too had been reduced in the councils draft budget mrs wideroos i shall leave it to you to choose a suitable adverb to characterise this reduction
unlike the invisible hand the internal consumer market is in this case organising its own selfregulation which will be coordinated and supported by the european institutions thereby enhancing the credibility of the union itself and its closeness to the citizens
the republic of macedonia with its 2 million citizens borders the eu
i should emphasise that public investment is also needed without prejudice to the involvement of private companies in the production and distribution of energy
i did not accuse any nation
we have no problem with the pact what we have is an implementation deficit
this initiative is in any case what the italian radical members are advocating
i know that some of you would have preferred to see more measures on renewables and energy efficiency projects in the package but i believe that the compromise finally found on this subject is a good one
it is the case that in the past we in the european parliament made matters easy for ourselves by rejecting every proposal for amending the europol convention
we have established the right to withdraw from a petition
the major powers did not find fault with the dictatorial nature and the corruption of the regime in zimbabwe until its dictator mr mugabe started in order to preserve his power to make a few demagogical gestures calling into question the privileges of the white farmers
not surprisingly therefore mr fischlers colleague mrs de palacio has expressed global reserve on every aspect of the proposed reform and i share that global reserve
after that we will have a chance of achieving them
lt every time we discuss yet another summit of heads of state or government to solve economic problems we recognise that the results achieved are good but unfortunately we lag behind events and the implementation mechanism for these decisions is unclear
in order to make sure the headache is not so severe this year i shall restrict myself to three questions why has parliament decided to produce a report despite the fact that the commission has chosen to ratify the previous reports
the second point is the inclusion of eu staff pensions in the budget
we have devoted a budget of eur 200 000 to it
what is missing however and this has already been mentioned is the absolutely crucial next step
we have very low unemployment among young people and we do not discriminate against them
the report is also very concerned about the dataprotectionprivacy issues related to obtaining information about peoples financial situation
this has been going on for years
sk the 2007 budget is the first in a sevenyear programming period and as such has undeniable strategic significance for the years ahead
the adoption of this proposal by the european legislature creates a new solid legal basis for the financing of european standardisation
special attention will be devoted to the issue of discards into the sea
let us also take a close look at the financing of the european union
our target ought to be to raise the awareness of purchasers and not necessarily to influence 1 of the passenger car market and 6 of the truck market with this directive
agricultural production on the african continent lags behind the growth in population
to conclude a tragedy such as this does not require rhetoric rather it requires effective tangible responses as well as a close eye to ensure that the earthquake rubble does not become the site for further profiteering and illicit practices that line the pockets of the big criminal groups
i feel it is important and i undertake on behalf of the peoples party to instigate this during 2008
that is why i am pleased that the public debate has intensified and that we have thus contributed to making the structure of our budgets more future oriented
as a representative of bulgaria one of the last member states to join i feel it is paramount for european institutions and in particular the european parliament to send the communitys inhabitants today a clear message of support to show that we are there to help in the difficult times of an economic crisis
in this connection i believe that my amendment should be carefully reread also by the rapporteur
member of the commission i would like to thank mr crowley for his question which gives me the opportunity to address the question of the followup to the judgment of the court of first instance of 13 june 2006 concerning irelands request for increase in capacity for fishing vessels on grounds of safety improvements
moreover such growth does not come about of its own accord
more and more citizens question if not the principle itself the scope and pace of future accessions
protectionism is actually a kind of neurosis which tends to affect societies and states at times when they are faced with serious crises such as the one we are experiencing
but if it does not work regardless of whether a large or small amount of work has been done the agreement must be amended or in any event we need to find other ways to make progress
there is a long way still to go and mrbarroso has not shown that he dares take the leap of becoming the voters servant
hence our abstention from the vote

i would argue that having taken a major step this week towards the political and geographical unity of europe if we are to create european citizens we must have services of general interest universally available accessible affordable and of high quality
if yushchenko wins we must be prepared to free up large amounts of additional funding to support the transformation of ukraine and we should send out a clear message now that we are prepared to do so
parliament has been pressing us for a european year of sport in previous resolutions the last of which was in 1997
the citizens of europe are the judges of our actions
so this could still go to appeal and we need to keep an eye on these cases
at its first reading the council retained the figures in the preliminary draft budget
reconstruction should be carried out within a clear framework that establishes the forms of participation by the countries and international organisations but it is equally desirable that pending the emergence of the conditions for this shared framework there should be no lack of contributions from a large number of countries willing to take part in the reconstruction of iraq
i also think that the initiation of a longterm project in the energy sphere like the connection of the baltic states to the nordic electricity networks also sends the right signal for it is rather up to the member states themselves to resolve issues to overcome the shortterm crisis taking into account their specific situations
i put this question in relation to a new project which is apparently going to be implemented very soon neptune which would involve the central mediterranean
if we want integration to develop we must attribute greater importance to the member states which support integration and are not its enemies
the first of these is that it is those european economies that are most open to globalisation that now have the best economic development
unwanted conflict with similar organs such as the european council high commission for human rights should also be avoided
the priorities are revision of aspects relating to consumer information on fisheries products and a more equitable distribution of the value added to the products along the whole marketing process with special emphasis on the initial point of sale
successful adoption of the new constitution would allow for such modernisation although we should probably also discuss the way the commission itself works and the way parliament and all institutions work as the abundance of programmes and abundance of agencies gives citizens the wrong impression they simply do not know where to turn
ro in my capacity as vicepresident of envi i would like to make several remarks concerning the impact of climate change on agriculture
it is a known fact that all the member states of the european union demanded the disarmament of iraq and the destruction of any weapons of mass destruction it may have had
first and foremost for me the safety of blood and blood products carries top priority
they should not be put at risk and punished even more by the terrible regime
finally this is my last speech in this parliament and i want to thank on behalf of the president all the members and the commissioner and the commission for the way in which they have cooperated with me over these five years of intense and exciting activity in this european parliament
i would ask that we observe a minutes silence in tribute to anna politkovskaya and the 63 journalists who have been murdered while carrying out their work
as far as the western sahara conflict is concerned it has gone on far too long
let us just consider what the euro is worth to us today
i am in fact convinced that the proposals put forward in this report do not represent a chance to improve the operation of regional policy which is an extremely important policy for tackling the imbalance in development within the european union and one which enjoys substantial financial support
the border conflict between chad and sudan is making the situation worse
new user services have been developed
i welcome the launch of the portal in december 2009
i am sorry to say that the commission seems to have forgotten european citizenship this neglect is illustrated in a brochure which the commission has recently published called whos who in the european union
fifthly the introduction of tolerance thresholds for animal proteins adventitiously and unavoidably present i want to stress that in plantbased feeds takes account of reality and removes problems in the sectors concerned without affecting safety
the national states and the european institutions can put up all the barbed wire they like both literally and in legal terms to prevent this happening but they will not succeed
mr president first of all i would like to congratulate the presidentinoffice on getting through so many answers in this question time
this series of steps will be taken again every six years on a cyclical basis
i would also like to thank my colleagues from the committee on agriculture and rural development and especially the experts for the support they have given in promoting this report
mr president the fact that neither bulgaria nor romania have completely finished their homework should not come as a surprise to anyone for it is a herculean task
in great britain 425 of all 15 yearold boys have used cannabis
there is therefore good reason to stand up for what until now has been a wise policy on the part of the european parliament
we all agree with the principle of reducing polluting emissions that underlies the proposals by the commission and the member states
if we evaluate the draft budget before us against these criteria the amount which corresponds to payments of 096 of community gdp is basically adequate but only if the council does not chop it down at second reading
i am concerned if we cannot stand united in the world in order to fight for social justice and social progress in the developing countries
in this sense it is a blot on the european landscape
the netherlands will soon be debating a law on intelligence and security services in parliament this law legitimises echelontype activities
silence leads to stillness and stillness leads to a standstill
my second point concerns equal treatment
firstly how can we ensure that democracy is respected on similar occasions in the future
support for the idea of creating two ejustice internet portals seems justified
pl mr president the situation regarding human rights in iran is not improving
what are trivial are certain speeches we heard at the beginning of this debate which put domestic political interests before the future of thousands of families in galicia or andalusia which is quite simply disgraceful and i regret that the people or person who said that are absent
it is instead the form of the text that is to be criticised it is a regulation to be directly applied in all member states
my question to the presidentinoffice though relates to the eu drugs strategy within the framework of justice and home affairs which the dutch presidency has prioritised
that being said this principle is obviously inappropriate for a great many situations that should be approached at community level
i call for a safety precinct or nogo zone round the house and at the access to the eastman building which we also use for our parliamentary work
the recent arrest of three ira activists in columbia brings home very clearly how widespread terrorism is throughout the world and how terrorists cooperate in the development of new and better weapons

sixty per cent of people who suffer foetal alcohol syndrome end up in prison or in psychiatric institutions
this is unacceptable for french people but also for every man and woman that advocates humanism
we further do not believe that brussels should arrange for topdown initiatives and funding to enable eu parties to engage in dialogue with their constituencies on eu matters
what i actually said was that i believe it is all well and good to resort to private funds but public funds must be invested also and that the commission is prioritising private funds
the commitment and contribution of the two sides of industry is very important
it starts regrets the agreement reached on the financial framework 20072013 in particular the reductions in the structural funds from 047
such texts of course presuppose clearer agreements between their authors
mr president honourable members of the european parliament at the second reading in january i commented that there was extensive agreement between the institutions on the programme and i hoped at that time that this would be an indication that the three institutions could quickly come to a final agreement on the programme
it is true that the results of the negotiations on the doha development agenda influenced the negotiating process
it is only when parliament council and commission and indeed the member states work well together that the european union collectively can deliver the support that is needed for the un system
but while we can hope that the commission will be firm and vigilant in the matter we may be forgiven for having more fears about the council where there will have to be a real political will to implement this integrated strategy for the protection of marine resources
for the benefit of customers it should be laid down in our draft documents and in this connection i also welcome the new financial service being set up by the irish post office in ireland
agriculture basically it calls for the second pillar of agricultural policy the development of rural areas to be extended taking appropriate account of the contribution made by farming to the environment and the countryside and the multifunctional character of agriculture
the other question too croatia turkey slovenia romania and bulgaria have demonstrated one thing we are now following the rules more closely and glossing over things less
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen what we are aiming at includes less bureaucracy and greater simplicity this single regulation is meant to replace four basic directives on pesticide residues
this is an internal political debate of a member state a debate that must be held and resolved inside the frontiers of the state concerned
we now have to deal very seriously with this issue and make legal preparations to respond on a casebycase basis to the us request
however we also know that we will in due course have to address what to do about this text
nor does article 152 mean that we should just sit back and watch people die
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i should first of all like to thank mrs oomenruijten for the fact that in her report this house is clearly making a strong appeal in favour of an ambitious social agenda for the european union

mr president all of us in this chamber are in favour of the arts and of promoting the arts and education in our respective countries
farmers within and without the union should be granted freedom and equality

adopting the commission proposal in its original form would undermine the result achieved in the netherlands
i have no doubts whatsoever about that because the general performance by customs within the european union has been very positive
i know that the staff of the institutions will recognise the fact that serious and committed attention has been given by parliament to their statute their employment conditions and their future

we remain convinced that it is through cooperation with our allies not antagonism or retaliation that we will defeat those who seek to destroy our values and principles through violence and hatred
we have a shared responsibility for ensuring that it is possible to fish for cod in the baltic sea in the future too
we have to look at some of the structural barriers that we as a society are also putting in place in terms of active inclusion
i consider such practices to be atrocious violations of the human right to personal integrity
madam president this report is about the present and future prospects for the kashmiri people and we must not lose sight of that
they want to be asked what they want they want to make decisions they want to be involved in the discussions on the future of europe and they want that to be taken into account

mr president i would like to ask you to intervene to prevent responsibility for the un world summit on the information society being given to a person whose hands are stained with blood from torture which would thus as a result penetrate the internet and the information society
alongside the shortterm measures we must then also reflect upon the big picture and ensure that we learn to think better in terms of systems in our societies in particular we must help the poor or developing countries to develop research skills so that they are themselves able to develop strategies that are both more profitable financially speaking and more sustainable in environmental terms
the problem is though that this has completely passed the people of europe by
how should the role of the european commission be defined
i have indeed noted that my position is in the minority although i do not feel ill at ease
this matter needs to be examined in depth and we need to make this country understand that it cannot be the troublemaker of europe before it has even joined europe
after all it has to be made quite clear that unless we succeed in making the breeding and keeping of all animals be they from the eu or imported from third countries subject to the same rules there will be no benefit to european farmers european animals or even european consumers as production methods will simply not be as desired
the european commission must do its utmost with the help of international organisations such as the council of europe or the world organisation for animal health to make the wto give more attention to animal welfare and to upward harmonisation of measures relating to it
i am sorry that certain social services are still excluded from the directive services like affordable housing and support for children and families must not be subject to the laws of competition but must aim solely at meeting the beneficiaries interests

the fact that the european union is the african countries most serious economic partner and that most aid to africa comes from europe also imposes a special responsibility on the union
it has a vision of europe that goes far beyond the sum of the 15 national realities
it angers me to hear that it is scandalous for the union to devote 45 of its budget to agriculture
the reinforcement of our legislation and of our systems however necessary it may be will not on its own be enough to prevent the reappearance of such an epidemic
renationalisation of the common agricultural policy was introduced in the new member states which in 2004 paid as much as 75 to the first pillar while the old fifteen members benefit from 100 eu support
commissioner some good projects have been worked out by womens organisations but those organisations need more information on access to the commissions system of financing and aid
both capitals are aware that they have to speed up and reinforce their efforts in certain fields and i strongly believe that they are going to be successful in fulfilling the expectations of the european union as expressed by its parliament and most of the expectations of their own people
firstly there is the size of the budget we have and enlargement which will also lead to an increase in the mountainous area within the european union while at the same time we refuse to produce any resources to finance the very idealistic proposals in this report which most people in this house would subscribe to

as described in the report by mr vakalis we must learn to live with earthquakes and be completely prepared for them
in some countries however there has been an increase in employment and women in particular have benefited from this
when we give in and ease off this pressure losing sight of the advantages for the european economy as a whole then we are sealing ourselves off and putting our collective head in the sand
in my opinion in local public transport this should be a principle that we all keep to and i believe we want to do so
speaking as i am on behalf of the committee on budgets i am concerned that the ambitions are not backed by resources

anyone who incurs debt for debts sake is selling off the future
substances must not of course be included in such a list on a mere whim

as far as both technical and widerranging questions raised by the honourable members are concerned it is not the councils responsibility to assess the technical effectiveness of the mechanism created by the wtos decision of 30 august 2003
these are the major unresolved questions on which europe must show that it is capable of making a political contribution and taking practical steps as a single entity capable of taking direct responsibility for achieving security capable of placing the emphasis on a culture of increasingly widespread democracy and focusing on its relationship with issues of security a culture of democracy capable of dialogue with the worlds and traditions of the various ethnic and religious groups
i can take no blame for this
we hope that in the codecision procedure parliament and the council will approve the commissions proposal so that we will have cars consuming less energy less fuel and emitting less carbon dioxide

so as far as reforms are concerned we can discuss them we can take action and this is what i have tried to do in a small way

today nobody should say quils mangent de la brioche let them eat cake
the public sector in europe will therefore serve as an example promoting more advanced innovative technologies in order to produce sustainable transport systems in the future
we start from a most regrettable situation noncompliance with the pact on the part of a growing number of member states is clearly a serious breach of good budgetary behaviour
furthermore in its review of the energy tax directive the commission will look at how it can better support the eus energy and climate policy encouraging energy efficiency and emission reductions

the current system of productionrelated aid is not only stimulating the human and environmental desertification of the southern part of our continent but is also making the work of those who adulterate olive oil easier enabling them to cheat the community budget cheat consumers of their right to buy a natural highquality product and cheat the farmers

candidate countries such as poland should participate fully in the definition of an entirely new european agricultural policy

eu countries would buy on the open market or support their former colonies just as they wish without repercussions on the world market

for that reason mr barroso i believe that the good proposals that have already been made years ago by commissioner vitorino as part of the tampere process should again feature in your programme

and article 21 states that all discrimination is prohibited and in particular discrimination on the grounds of sex race etc
unlike the majority of the french electorate you have shown yourself to be zealously proeuropean even going as far as presenting once again in the barely different form of the lisbon treaty the constitution which along with the dutch the french people rejected in 2005

this assessment will cover a number of possible options for an eulevel reform of the corporate income tax system
the question whether it would be a useful initiative on the part of the european commission to set up a debt department as the world bank did recently does not fall within my remit as you will understand but within that of the commission
this would be unfair to the people and the victims of these floods
mrs sudre and mrs langenhagen came with me
we need to invest to give workers the skills to work in that new economy we need strong active labour market policies to quickly reintegrate workers laid off and we need strong and viable social protection systems to support those who find themselves unemployed through no fault of their own
well we were told we are in talks with brazil and we are in talks with india as if we needed to compensate in some way for the memory of british imperialism by the memory of portuguese or spanish imperialism
the sitting is suspended
my services and i are now analysing those contributions and will draw our conclusions and present them together with an impact assessment before summer 2006
this will also stimulate an improvement of the project proposals we get from our implementing partners and we can already see clearly this effect
it is only fair to do so if we recognise social partnership
obviously if there is little movement during the day a small increase in noise levels could be acceptable in view of the almost ridiculously small number of planes passing through
it is equally important for these targets to be closely linked to education and research
if the palestinian authorities arrest those who continue to attack israeli civilians there will be no need for helicopter gunships to attack palestinian civilian areas
these are siblings of animals that are sick
what then is the eus responsibility in terms both of its values and of its own best interests
mr president i would like to speak about only one aspect of energy prices namely the price of district heating
i am myself in favour of them
of course we reject the suggestion of specific privileged bilateral cabotage between neighbouring countries because as one of my fellow members rightly said it fragments the market still further
their landings represent the largest amount of global reported catches
the reason for our debate is as the joint resolution says that the measures taken by the uk government to control this disease have failed that new outbreaks are appearing and that there is a very real risk of the disease spreading again to mainland europe
i would have liked to have heard along with the references to the eus successes more said about the disappointment of peoples expectations and the crisis of confidence in the union
europe also needs to share with our traditional allies an international policy that promotes democracy and peace in our neighbouring countries and which contributes to a safer and more developed world
the ejustice project was among those discussed during the portuguese presidency and it therefore fell to portugal to guide the development and implementation of the pilot project which will allow all citizens to access services in other member states in a simpler cheaper and more convenient manner and in their own language
we shall be doing no one any favours if we concede too much
on 23 june the european union council of fisheries ministers will take a series of decisions on the crisis in the fishing sector which is conjunctural and structural
for myself and many others it is unclear how the conventions proposal would work in practice
however amendments passed in the unemployment committee reverse the direction and turn the report into a regressive socialist wishlist of deeply harmful proposals
these are important aspects
this study has three objectives to define the mountain regions of the enlarged eu to create a database of these regions and to carry out an objective analysis of the situation in mountain regions and of existing community and national policies and to evaluate those policies
on behalf of the pse group fr mr president i would first of all like to congratulate the commission on having attached a high priority to a communication policy and in particular on having already implemented it within parliament
the only things we did agree at that conciliation were two bland statements one on agriculture one on category 5 but parliament made a unilateral statement concerning the fisheries
what is known as mustcarry should not get in the way of the digital switchover on the contrary it is in our eyes a guarantee for maximum distribution
mrpresident ladies and gentlemen i too should like to express my solidarity with the victims although solidarity alone is not enough we have to make a solemn commitment to the victims that we will make a serious and determined effort to prevent such disasters
admittedly the actual situation is somewhat anomalous 16 member states with the single currency 27 national economic policies coordinated by the commission as well as it can and 11 member states with national currencies
unfortunately the processing of these applications by the european commission drags on for years
question time commission
we have therefore chosen to vote against the report
it is a politically created negative situation
as has been stated several times before it is a worldwide fight but a worldwide fight also requires a worldwide response
we said that in order to combat poverty we needed to enter into a close partnership with the poorest people
if the emissions trading playing field were global auctions would be a good option
i should like to say to mr brok that this is not a matter of blaming anyone but it is in my view impossible not to recognise that the weakening of the nonproliferation treaty which was clearly due also to the failure of the 2005 conference was a fatal mistake
i am in venice the most beautiful city in the world there is the moon there are the gondolas we are on the grand canal italian cooking spaghetti with sepia dom pérignon french champagne and a blonde beauty who takes me back to my youth
the report presents a large number of references to the existence of a global interception system
commissioner ladies and gentlemen the galileo programme is both very ambitious and extremely challenging in scientific and technical terms which is why it is so costly as well as attracting a great deal of interest the programme has therefore also provoked a variety of opinions and reactions
in that resolution parliament invited the commission to make it clear that the 2005 recommendation applied exclusively to online sales of music recordings and to present as soon as possible after consulting closely with interested parties a proposal for a flexible framework directive to be adopted by parliament and the council in codecision with a view to regulating the collective management of copyright and related rights as regards crossborder online music services while taking account of the specificity of the digital era and safeguarding european cultural diversity
pensions based on savings must be an important part of pensions systems in the future
another example negotiations have been going on for 10 years without producing any results whatsoever on reducing vat rates for some sectors involving highly demanding manual work or a high proportion of manual work
the next item is the report a501962003 by mr wijkman on behalf of the committee on development and cooperation on the commission communication to the european parliament and to the council on energy cooperation with the developing countries
those whom mr sarkozy rightly describes as scum however can count on subsidies and redcarpet treatment
mrpresident the measures contained in the citizens for europe programme will help create sound principles for coexistence and interaction between nations
again these are security issues linked for example to the fight against terrorism because inequality and oppression are the breeding ground of hatred intolerance and violence
i believe that we shall do well and that mr solanas proposals will be the first step towards the unions subsequently acquiring independence in its relations with all the powers of the world
i would like to make the following comments
it would seriously undermine the deconcentration process since we need to know the funds available in order to recruit and train staff
will it then be suggested that we must produce much more carbon dioxide to try and offset the cooling
it is the history we have lived through and we know it well even if there are times when we need to move forward more quickly
i would like to recall here the rapporteurs words during the last debate in the committee on regional policy transport and tourism where he said that he could not see how there could be a committee of inquiry that after everything he had studied in drawing up his report and the contributions in the committee on regional policy transport and tourism it would be difficult to push forward the idea of a committee of inquiry
i hope you will take that on board
mr president i welcome all three reports but i shall first speak on guardianship
these proposals underline an 85 reduction in fishing fleet
maintaining a stable situation in the european unions neighbouring countries is no less important
yes mr pirker i am looking at the same report as you
he got that absolutely right and it comes up again in the text of the work programme in which the commission commits itself and i quote to the delivery of an active policy agenda focusing on citizens expectations and needs
however lobster producers could set up producers organisations in order to strengthen their position in the market
no
moreover during the vote we took in july to set a threshold of 05 or 1 for the adventitious contamination of gmos did we show impartiality
however the significant difference between the two countries is that while bulgaria acknowledges the problems related to the roma population romania would like to conceal and deny them
whilst i share your aims and always want to do things as quickly as we can and mr kirkhopes aims of price transparency and consumer protection i think that in our speed to get this through we have drifted away certainly from the position that the committee on transport adopted at the end of may and that the position that council has come up with the socalled compromise position is different from the position that we went for in the committee on transport
it is parliaments and the councils wish for member states to be able to take more extensive measures
i think that this assessment is quite appropriate as i am a strong believer in the importance of the solidarity which member states need to show in their joint actions to combat the effects of the financial crisis and reduce the adverse impact of the global economic crisis
firstly to the extent that it has been shown that eu member states participate in echelon does this whole business not amount to anything more than a blatant violation of the eu treaty
the events of the last few weeks have rocked the european union to its foundation
i apologise mr president i did not realise there was a problem with the interpretation
there is a cost but the cost is manageable

hundreds of those sentenced to death are people unable to afford a fair trial
citizens are free within the union but they may also become a victim of an offence in one of the member states
i should also like to point out that the funding of the implementation of the lisbon strategy objectives should not be at the expense of eu cohesion policy
cohesion policy supports for instance the protection of our cultural heritage the development of cultural infrastructure and services the development of regional attractiveness and its link with sustainable tourism but also the regeneration of local economies and the development of crossborder strategies
commissioner please allow me to be a little forward
at this time we think of the coalition troops in iraq some 30 000 of them from a member state of the european union
mr president ladies and gentlemen commissioner as chairman of the delegation of the european parliament with the central asian countries which covers turkmenistan i receive weekly reports on the continuous violation of human rights in turkmenistan
they represent a whole new approach which we know to be the clear result of the last council meeting
it will provide the opportunity to indicate good intentions at a symbolic level but on a practical level very little will happen
it is a problem but i would nevertheless like to thank you for our good personal cooperation on the substance of the report
a few days ago on 10 december the former financial secretary now acting chief executive donald tsang said in a speech in hong kong the free flow of information the freedom to say and do what we want are the very fabric of hong kong society
if we do not control the flood it threatens to sweep across the region engulfing iran syria saudi arabia and turkey
simplification however is just as important as it prevents an endless breakdown of all citizens rights rights which would actually lose their importance if they differed in every case
the order of business was adopted
el mr president we do not agree with the political approach of this budget because it increases military spending and because it slowly but surely merges its policy with nato policy
draft general budget for 2007 amended by the council all sections financial regulation applicable to the general budget of the european communities draft amending budget no 62006 debate
we now need to get started on implementation and one reason why we have set relatively tight deadlines for parliament and for the council is that we want to ensure that we do not have to wait too long for implementation
with provocative disdain for the declared will of the peoples to reject the european constitution they are calling for the campaign to brainwash the people to be intensified so that they are ultimately forced to accept it they even set as a target its promotion by the end of 2008
in writing pt we welcome the approval of the report on the cmo in fisheries products which sends a clear signal to the european commission that an ambitious revision of this cmo is urgently needed in order to increase its contribution to guaranteeing incomes in the sector improving the marketing of fisheries products and increasing the added value of these products notably by means of a substantial increase in funding
secondly even where people become prisoners or political prisoners as the result of terrorist activities which i do not condone but which i cannot deny solitary confinement must be abolished or at least reduced to what is humanly bearable
however one of the issues that has not been addressed in the debate is the reality of a substantial trade in commercial bumblebees
equally and for the same reasons of ensuring impartiality public media operators should be independent and not subject to interference by governmental authorities
this is also true in the case of active ingredients on which there was a resolution last year tabled by mrs sartori and myself which i see has been taken up by the commission
i am sure that parliament will join me in expressing condolences and profound sympathy to the members of both communities who have suffered loss and bereavement including relatives of my own london constituents
paradoxically it could be said that the more complaints the better
third we identify a large number of practical actions to improve our internal coordination on un questions in the un bodies themselves in brussels and also in the member states with the overall aim of enhancing our influence in the un and in an attempt to assist it more effectively
however the direction suggested by amendment 35 whereby the commission commits to conducting a study on this issue and reporting by 2018 is acceptable
there may be high traffic density which can under certain circumstances make the transport of dangerous goods even more hazardous
the participation of nongovernmental organisations from our countries is often the determining factor in terms of our interventions achieving good results
i think it is timely and i return to my point i still believe that the majority of contacts should be left to the member states and that we in europe should be more specific and more targeted in the areas that we want to see inspected
1
it is a system of this kind that is required
however this very rigour is leading the commission again to postpone its decision on bulgarias and romanias accession date
in that way our leaders would be forced to devise a document that could be approved by the voters and the next treaty would give more influence to the voters instead of taking influence away from them as the constitution does
one of these signals relates directly to the subject of our debate today
mr president i would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to commissioner liikanen mr rocard and vicepresident onesta for their input today and for all the hard work they have done to date
as soon as your committee tables the report it can be placed on the agenda
as a result we know that fishermen in the deepwater fishery regularly discard around 55 of all the fish they catch
the draft amendments adopted by the committee on transport and tourism largely reflect the councils position
that can be found in the exhaustive explanation which has been sent to you
the eu is making us poorer and less democratic and less free and we have had enough of it
i am confident that with the help of all of you we will achieve the objectives laid down in this treaty article
therefore i am obliged to the commission for presenting a proposal to parliament although parliament did think that the proposal needed tightening up
i agree with the rapporteurs position as regards the objective of simplifying the financing structure in order to make funding more efficient and transparent
i was a member of the observation mission sent to monitor the elections and i saw for myself the way in which they were conducted
this however is what is implied by the proposal to make the european union a permanent member as soon as its legal personality is recognised
i would also like to wish the commission success in implementing and monitoring this regulation
eu membership compelled finland to lower tax on alcohol when the right to restrict imports of alcohol ended
surely that jewish dream demands a european effort too
however they have clear political guidelines and we do of course elucidate specific results which must be achieved in each sector linked in several cases to quantitative targets
before the council was convened the view was expressed that this council should not meet or that it should deal solely with the war in iraq
sweden and the june list believe that both advertising aimed at children and that relating to alcohol should be completely prohibited
the use of these signposts is compulsory at airports
whilst mr sterckx obliges ports not to turn ships away mr savary says that they can deny entry if insurance certificates are not being provided
i do not believe that it is impossible to expand further without the lisbon treaty
it is more of a shot in the arm than a therapy
a good overdraft facility at the bank is needed if money from the social fund is to be received
i accept that we should not target such fisheries for excessive controls
space is our new european frontier
i am familiar with these sorts of stories from hamburg because we always thought that our neighbours outside of hamburg would pay incredibly low wages
there are no quick fixes for terrorism
first of all it is necessary to adhere strictly and rigorously to the tax regulations set out in the modified version of the stability and growth pact
apart from that there is a large group in chad totalling 180 000 people who have become internally displaced due to the internal security conditions
as i have said from the beginning what is important for us is how we can best achieve results not the legal instruments we employ to do so
mr president this report is concerned with n1 vehicles which is commission jargon for vans
the green paper also fully recognises the member states competence in labour law and their own labour relations and traditions and progress on collective bargaining
i welcome parliaments positive attitude to finding ways of resolving the problem whilst respecting the member states right to establish whether employment relations are involved in a case
applause from the left
all negotiations require a certain level of confidentiality
my vote was not a negation of the graça moura report quite the contrary
it is their choice whether they take drugs in prison
ladies and gentlemen we have to take action against this
i now give the floor to mr nicolaï to answer the first question by mrs ludford on fair trials for european citizens and european residents
thirdly i do not believe and i am addressing mrs morgantini here that it is for us to define rights when we can see that the law is being ridden roughshod over by people throwing bombs and killing sevenyear old children on the other side
colleagues i have to draw your attention to the fact that we have among us observers from both romania and bulgaria and they are very welcome
we do not know who the new president will be although i do have a personal preference
there are two basic reasons for this firstly terrorism does not stop at borders and secondly terrorism is a global threat it can happen and indeed has happened anywhere in the world
all that i know is that those ministers that are members of ecofin and especially those that belong to the euro group decided to launch a very intensive campaign which is to be stepped up with effect from now because they decided that if they had started during the summer there was a risk of the impact being lost during that period so that it would have been necessary to start all over again
we must be outwardlooking in this parliament
a campaign is therefore to be launched
first of all a huge majority is in favour of the idea of more decoupling and i am very appreciative of this idea
such initiatives at european level would show our commitment to a better political future for the peoples of iraq
the commission reserves the right to reexamine this matter
for example 43 of europeans continue to believe that a work permit is required if they want to work in any other member state
statistics show that if in the current perspective we had maintained the budget at the level it was in the period 19931999 calculated according to the same percentage of gdp we would have an additional eur 200 billion available for the realisation of european policies
consequently to my mind the agreement and the corresponding legislative proposal by the commission violates international law
i believe that this report will help the people in the region and also assist the indiapakistan peace process
a european asylum policy must also reinforce the fundamental rights of asylum seekers
for a number of years there have been problems in timor mainly concentrated in west timor at the moment as well as in the moluccas in aceh in irian jaya and now again in kalimantan
thankfully this proposal was today rejected by the majority of the member states
i am convinced that this time crisis management must lead to a real turnaround in waste management policy in order to avoid further risks to human health and the environment
from teheran to shiraz to mashhad to alzahra the web of iranian universities participating in this consortium looks particularly promising
this issue is of enormous importance and the commission should have come forward with more concrete ideas rather than referring to various proposals that have already been made by other people
we in the parliament are proud of our commitment in this union to the politics of sustainability locally and globally not least in our constant promotion of the kyoto protocol
there really is a vital need for us in the eu to assume a global responsibility at the world conference in johannesburg
we can see after all that trade growth and consumption have all risen since may 2004 stability and democracy have been strengthened and europe is better equipped to face our common problems
it is not the fault of the court that the european union has decided to have such an excessive number of working languages
by the end of 2008 the commission has also committed itself to conduct a crosssectoral stocktaking exercise of the coherence equivalence and actual use of sanctioning powers among member states
you talk commissioner in that package about an energy partnership with africa
unfortunately too before the prestige and the erika there were many other cases where not only was there no safe haven there was no political will either on the part of this parliament or the council or on the part of anyone to adopt measures that would prevent what happened with the erika or the prestige
mr president the atmosphere is a lot more pleasant this evening
indeed if we want to deliver we need instruments and that puts us in a dilemma
i look forward to the time when i the israelis and the palestinians will have the right to citizenship which is not your or our prisons
i was also moved by the image that commissioner patten conjured up that if we enter into the fight against terrorism in a way we have one hand tied behind our backs
the regulation governs any variations required be it on publichealth or economic grounds after a medicinal product has already been authorised
this house must also call upon the international community and the security council to respond with greater firmness than they have to date
sudan is nevertheless able to find the resources to bomb its own villages that stand in the way of its oil wells and is also choosing to starve its inhabitants in the south of the country
i shall therefore dwell on a few points that complement what has just been said
the commission has been completely inactive in this area
we cannot endanger it through exports which are dangerous from a health point of view of any genetically modified organisms which we do not accept here
the european union is in fact indias largest trading partner but india only ranks fourteenth for the countries of europe
i have read mr president of the commission that you want to give the romanian candidate the job of commissioner for multilingualism
it madam president ladies and gentlemen i will focus on the globalisation adjustment fund
membership of the cotonou agreement would have provided the right framework to develop a structured dialogue with the cuban authorities and to improve the delivery of aid to that country
i am pleased that he himself indicated that there is of course a national responsibility where legislation the implementation the organisation of the ratification and also of possible referendums are concerned and that this does not fall within the remit of brussels
nevertheless economists governments and the european commission continue their relentless pursuit of ever more liberalism
we need active dialogue between european nations and citizens
these problems need to be solved and the new questions such as minority rights warrant adequate joint european answers
it is therefore vital that we as quickly as possible enable new legislative instruments to be adopted
it is important that the european union sends a coherent message to the other parties to the convention and that at the same time we demonstrate our commitment to its principles and rules
for example in the case of services of general interest or other services that are essential for the member states and the regions i am convinced that there is a need for derogating provisions
furthermore we believe that it is an excellent idea to obtain greater economic support for the sectors potential for container traffic although there are still great deficiencies here
we worked hard and made significant concessions in order to achieve as broad a consensus as possible within parliament and i would therefore like to congratulate mr goepel on his willingness for dialogue and on the real spirit of compromise he showed i would also like to congratulate mr parish on the way in which he led our work in committee
do you remember when the fiveyear plans were announced to be successes often before they were even launched with much talk of record harvests and wonderful production figures for tractors
the it stock market bubble has now burst
the european union has the power to ask it and i believe that there is an urgent need for this both in the interests of security and in the interests of the policing of shipping and climate preservation to continue initiatives which could produce surplus energy
we shall now proceed to the vote on the proposal for a decision on the appointment of the new commissioner proposed by the republic of bulgaria mrs meglena kuneva
to be open and frank with you as i always am i was disappointed with this decision
if the violence does not cease we will have to do something to assist the process from outside
this is a time for celebration and as i said i am very moved
we need first to get the overall framework right before proposing specific solutions
this gives rise to concern
however what happened was a disgrace
against this background the commission developed a comprehensive community strategy concerning mercury which was adopted in january 2005
so i shall refrain from doing so
there was no trial no sentence he was quietly released when the world stopped looking
therefore amendments 6 and 10 cannot be accepted
jeer on if you like but have you noticed that on the bond markets this morning greek bonds are trading 233 basis points higher than german bonds
another group that will not benefit are people who live in the country or in remote areas and will have to rely on private postal services for we shall see a creeping erosion of service levels down to the minimum possible and permissible
the commissions current practice of accounting on spreadsheets lends itself to poor administration and fraud
mr president what we learned from the dutch and french referenda was that many people sadly see the eu as part of the threat of globalisation rather than offering a safe haven from its colder winds
bringing an end to further expansion of the settlements not even to the settlements themselves should have been a first gesture towards the palestinians as a sign that the israelis also want a compromise but sadly the israeli government was unwilling to make that gesture
we have called on them time and again not to underestimate the simmering ethnic conflict and to do everything to prevent such conflict from breaking out
that is i believe unacceptable
cooperation between the eu member states and between those states and other countries is already a reality a reality that could be further encouraged and developed but which already ensures respect for each countrys sovereignty for workers and their rights guaranteeing social harmonisation in particular by the application of the most favourable conditions and for the rights of users
austria has proven that plenty of foresight realism consultation and commitment are evidently all that is needed in order to be successful on many fronts and that deserves credit
it was precisely because the postal services were to some degree sheltered from competition and from the pursuit of profit that they were able to perform their role it was because they did not exist to be profitmaking but to provide a service that they served the most secluded villages and crisscrossed the land with a dense network of post offices
we now have a unique opportunity to consider what we want as well as what we want the future eu to look like between 2007 and 2013 and that is an opportunity we must not waste
president abbas honourable members the european parliament is very honoured that you are here today with us and the massive attendance at this plenary sitting is evidence of that
very good very pleasant but please can we now get it right
we need to ask ourselves what contemporary ukraine is actually like
madam president the european commission is of course extremely concerned at the many human rights violations including mass rapes taking place in the democratic republic of congo in consequence of a long period of conflict
the government president kuchma with the oligarchs supporting him behind the scenes and the russian president putin who yesterday started a visit to the ukraine lasting several days support their own candidate prime minister yanukovych
the creation of such a buffer for example with a view to an increase in the ageing population is indispensable
the present situation is that 24 member states signed it in 1998 and one country is ready to sign
the school milk scheme for example has proved itself to be highly effective and must be continued and expanded
i myself was rapporteur for the accession of slovakia for years and had a great deal to do with the roma issue
we must also make progress in analysing how added value is shared out along the chain
we have repeatedly asked for the scope of this action to be extended to other diseases particularly associated with poverty and with poor hygiene and environmental conditions
the rapporteur and the author of the amendment are agreed on this
i would like to illustrate the need for this by referring to a recent case which occurred in romania
unfortunately rather than standing up to those governments like germany the netherlands and the uk which adopted a shortsighted i want my money back approach the majority of this house and the commission have simply caved in to their demands
the excessive red tape that makes our economy less flexible the fact that we do not have enough world leaders and that our small and mediumsized enterprises are progressing less quickly than those in the united states of america low unemployment levels and low mean working times and finally weak investment in vocational training research and development all of this to a large extent explains the current situation
we share their concern regarding the risk of further proliferation of the conflict
in order to benefit from the policy member states are required to draw up a mediumterm strategy for the use of the resources to cofinance european aid from national budgets to work in partnership at national regional and local level and to respect eu laws and policies
yet the concept of one country two systems still applies in the areas of human rights democracy and freedom of speech

in the interests of the stability of this wing of the eu and in the interests of the internal stability of serbia with an emphasis on strengthening the territorial integrity of the country i propose that we do indeed accelerate the implementation of macrofinancial assistance
it shows that we are a long way from the objective of making the union a europe for citizens
the point i want to make here is that it is very nice to see that our decision last year to untangle the procurement of medicine for these diseases adds to the reality and impact of what was agreed in the wto last weekend
it is necessary for textile workers within the eu and those many in other parts of the world who seek to earn their living and improve their own economies and their own lives through the textiles industry
the beneficiaries of community financing are the european standardisation organisations cen cenelec and etsi which are listed in annexi of directive 9834ec of the european parliament and of the council laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations
climate policy offers ample opportunity for innovation and employment
as regards the endorsement of the policy plan on legal migration a key focus is on admission procedures capable of responding promptly to fluctuating demands in the labour market
if we are going to have a settlement we have to move away from that
the council s decision to include colombia in the list of countries whose citizens require visas to enter european union countries is not simply useless in the fight against the organised crime some colombian citizens might be involved in it also forces ordinary citizens to bear the additional cost of obtaining a visa
it welcomes the progress achieved in the financial markets and is in favour of stock options
politics and fishing just do not mix
fatuzzo ppede
yet it is prepared to state that this resolution leaves parliaments rights intact
i therefore proclaim these candidates elected as vicepresidents of the european parliament i congratulate each and every one of them on their election

clearly this is not an issue which can be resolved through legislation or binding measures
my opinion on film heritage and the competitiveness of related industrial activities allowed me to investigate the functioning of the european film industry an industry that produces films accounting for 25 of the european market
i also agree that we need to examine the extent to which a country has exorbitant expenditure for which it alone is not responsible as with greece and the extraordinary spending on the olympic games
furthermore this point is going to make it easier for us to reach an agreement with the united states
china is one of the countries that have signed the declaration yet violate the human rights of men women and children
if we are to achieve something in the next few weeks i ask you not to bring back the same commission that you would have presented to us today as otherwise we could have voted on it today
the next item is the report by lutz goepel on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development on the cap health check

we cannot have people returned via european arrest warrants to an eu country who are then sent back to a third country for torture
once the totalitarian regime that had suppressed them had been toppled all internal forces were unleashed sometimes violently
i have followed with growing astonishment the activities of the antiprohibitionists over recent months
i am of the view that we not only have to reduce our consumption levels but also localise it in a way that removes our dependence on the type of energy involved this will also create problems as is the case with coal which is a localised resource and one that has to be taken into account
i wish however to explain why i voted as i did on amendment66 the notorious disclosure clause
both applications are connected with the relocation of production to third countries causing 4 211 workers to be laid off

the ombudsman has already addressed many of the points made in my report
i will ask the services to make sure that is done
it is of course gratifying to have a show of respect for the constant work seven days a week and 20 hours a day and for what we achieved at the european council last week
however the eu could take the lead and set the standard by demanding more stringent rules
this means that it is quite possible at least according to the councils legal services that environmental effects will have a weighting of only 1 and thus that the impact on the environment will be relatively small
commissioner patten cannot be at our sitting today or tomorrow but he will appear before the committee on foreign affairs human rights common security and defence policy next monday
the commission supports proposals from parliament for reinforcing social dialogue on both a european and a national level with the aim of upholding the rights of workers from the new member states
this motion for a resolution expresses surprise at the fact that the commission questions the reliability of the international olive oil councils statistics
experience shows that the forecasts published by the commission both the macroeconomic and the fiscal figures are not biased and are at least as reliable as those of other forecasters
the prospect of a union of 25 is now a reality
although there is room for improvement how would the future look without our european social model
people fear being pushed out of the labour market and in order to prevent this from happening borders are closed yet nothing could be further from the truth
pension reform must be aimed at improving financial sustainability promoting longer working lives and removing the incentives for early retirements in order to make more flexible models for professional and employment development possible
such measures do not represent a disproportionate burden
mr president i wholeheartedly echo the comments of my group colleague mrs lichtenberger
in the light of the problems of infrastructure that wouldbe banana exporters in the least developed countries at present encounter it is difficult at this stage to assess with certainty what direct effect the regulation will have on the banana market
nevertheless allow me to make some criticisms
i have been a strong supporter of protection for nonsmokers for many years and i think that this report is another step in the right direction this is underlined by the commissions expectation that tobacco consumption will fall by 10 over the next five years
the commission from my side and that of my colleagues will work very hard to facilitate agreement between the parliament and the council this december
he was fully acquitted after many years of legal proceedings he was the victim of judicial error and media persecution of an abuse of media power

immigrant populations must comply with our legislation and our respect for the individual and not bring with them these unacceptable and barbaric practices
in the natural desire to show solidarity with the victims of natural disasters many nations spontaneously offer support but without clear coordination there is a risk that assistance will be duplicated or that what is sent will not meet the real needs of the affected region
applause
we are calling on the authorities to allow an unimpeded and open debate about the constitution before the referendum to stop persecuting political activists and to repeal laws that limit the freedom of expression
we are all aware of the problems with eurocontrol and enough is known about the difficulties of dividing air space efficiently between civil and military aircraft
while the judiciary will shed light we hope on the economic whodunit we need further enlightenment as regards the institutional whodunit

fr on my own behalf and on behalf of all members i would like to pay a very sincere tribute to mrs nicole fontaine
we expect this to have a positive effect on trade contributing to the development of intraregional trade in particular
after all as members we should lead by example
this unilateral provocation has undoubtedly been detrimental to croatias credibility and has undermined what are otherwise good relations in the region
however i would also like to thank the council and the presidency of the council very warmly at this point
we have not been in contact recently with the greek authorities concerning any privatisation plans
these would subject the agency to the following controls
no employee of the agency was involved in the fraud ultimately however the agency is responsible for control of the eu funds spent
ro mr president at the end of the year the european commission draws up the report regarding the barriers imposed on access to the labour market
we have managed to recognise one anothers documents
that for me is one of the fundamental aspects of this debate
the commission drew up a costbenefit assessment of this agreement which concluded that the protocol was a sizeable subsidy to the eu tuna fleets in these waters it led to a valueadded of eur17million
i ask for your support
mr president ladies and gentlemen i should like to echo the words of thanks to the commission for the present proposal
roads are underutilised we are withdrawing police stations and closing down little churches and schools
this oral amendment is therefore not put to the vote
we need good speakers but we also need practical action
i think commissioner pidla showed a reasonable degree of commitment to pursuing discriminatory treatment and i hope he sees it through he would redeem the commissions reputation from the example of franco frattini who merely weeks ago was exhorting us to observe justice and equality and is now an apologist for prejudice
to be quite frank there are serious deficiencies in this area in some european states
this programme makes all of this possible with the help of intermediaries who receive money from this programme
aids as well as killing more than 2 million people in africa is hindering the possibilities for development in a society by removing thousands of active young people and mothers who in turn leave behind orphans

when the european parliament s committee on employment and social affairs took the decision to put this question to you it had three objectives
if we can spot a lowest common denominator and i believe that we can then it is our shared repudiation of this sort of terrorism and that smallest common denominator is also an opportunity to begin dialogue an opportunity that we must make use of
i hope that we will be able to proceed in this manner throughout the whole procedure
with regard to the eus guidelines on human rights defenders the union has launched global campaigns on freedom of speech and womens human rights
in addition we must not forget in particular in the context of the debate on the european investment bank to ensure that there are no shadow budgets outside the community budget
in short it is a rather difficult case
in the coming years europe is facing a period of stagnation and the progressive ageing of its population
i believe that the commission has now grasped the seriousness of the situation and that a very extensive reform has been started
i also find it good given the worrying inflationary trends in many member states to reiterate that all necessary steps must be taken so that the inflation rate can be kept below 2 in the second half of 2001
it would therefore be helpful if parliament could explain to the commission that it too must follow the ground rules in each country
and i personally think it is highly interesting to look into a regional approach for instance in the north with cooperation with tajikistan on hydropower for electricity and for gaining water for irrigation of fields thus of course giving much better food production for the afghan population which could bring them away from drugs
if farmers are having to produce our food in a sort of spacesuit should we not be asking ourselves whether we should not be organising our food production differently
last but not least i would like to point out having just come from the committee on employment and social affairs that we continue to be concerned that core labour standards and principles of human rights should not be shelved and that they are of great importance particularly where china is concerned
to do so would be as i see it to misuse a highly volatile issue to whip up sentiment
unfortunately the palko clothing factory closed recently turning hundreds of workers out into the street
these people have appreciated our efforts and just the other day confirmed their faith in us by voting for socialist party candidates in their local councils
to this end we have enshrined a certain amount of flexibility in several of the instruments especially in relation to the points that caused differences between the member states

remarkably however the commission proposed that a strict check be put on cabotage opportunities

even though parliament the commission and the council have failed to even make a start on a debate about europes boundaries accession negotiations will almost certainly be opened with turkey a noneuropean country and one which by the time it actually accedes will have more than 80 million inhabitants
at least we managed to enforce budgetary discipline they say
at the same time we are offering to organise a highlevel roma forum aimed at bringing together representatives of national governments and parliaments the european parliament the european economic and social committee and the committee of the regions as well as leading figures from roma civil society and other important players
secondly we continue to monitor closely the state of human rights respect for fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in the country and raise our concerns with the belarussian government
in conclusion let us use common sense and keep things simple and in perspective
a heritage denied ignored or distorted leaves a society divorced from reality its true nature and character still oppressed still deprived of its birthright
likewise i think it is unfortunate if this parliament has in the past months become a place for scaremongering
we all know that the competition rules go back to 1957 that regulation 17 dates back to 1962 and that virtually all the framework conditions have changed since then
the gas pipeline in question would strengthen the energy security of the entire european union and thus its construction is a common interest
member of the commission mr president we share parliaments outrage at the increasing number of attacks in tanzania against the albino population and at the abhorrent and illegal trade in albino body parts linked to traditional medicine to superstition and to the practices of witch doctors
firstly i welcome the efforts of the french presidency at european level in the interests of social equality between genders but at the same time it seems contradictory that the local institutions dealing with equal opportunities are being closed down
the specific problem i tried to raise is whether the commission will focus particularly on the area where member states have fewer instruments to deal with this showing what is behind the protection of intellectual property and raising awareness among citizens
the last thing i have to say i say on my own account to all those who always recommend the development of nuclear energy as the solution to the problems of mankind i would remind them that every nuclear power plant and every enrichment facility that is built becomes in the hands of a criminal such as the north korean dictator something that puts the whole world at incalculable risk
we in the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe give priority to all tests aiming to promote informed purchasing decisions by consumers
mr gorostiaga your approach is totally out of line with what we in this house defend freedom of expression which you do not defend in any of your considerations and even less in your speech this afternoon
a minority of the eldr group believes that we should wait and see how these systems work and that we should apply the principle of subsidiarity
i will just make one very strong recommendation that i would like the commission to take into consideration we must not repeat our past error we must not see fishermen as the enemies of sustainable development the enemies of the endeavour to preserve a balance
we tried that and the banks are still not lending
member of the commission mr president i am pleased to express the commissions support for parliaments amendments to the ucits iv proposal
growth employment and social welfare belong together
we should not be discriminating according to the size of the business in the case of direct payments otherwise jobs would be jeopardised on a large scale
this also applies to states that are quite well off
that is exactly what we are doing
it was firmly established from the outset that this was not to be a cutthroat liberalisation
history teaches us that the greatest misfortune for human beings is to be uprooted from their place of origin and that immigration arises for countless reasons not all of them voluntary
we have to remind ourselves of this when discussing the question what about the requirement that parties be independent of the state
if almost all sectors are given such aid why should this sector which is so poor and so marginalised within europe not be given support
mr president enlargement will increase pressure on the margin of the budget
as the guardian of the treaty the commission attaches the utmost importance to the observance of those principles
thank you very much for your answer commissioner
this outcome created great uncertainty for a number of reasons
i hope that they will lead in time to a constructive exchange of opinions but this is not the right time and place to touch on all these different aspects
our vote against shows our opposition both to the guidelines of the economic policies based on the stability pact and to changes contained in the report that also point in the same direction
you are in breach of the treaty and of existing legislation
the second condition would be to reject the idea of a statute for political parties which was introduced by the treaty of nice it seems to have more to do with bureaucracy than with a free society
mr president as draftsman of the opinion for the report of the committee on agriculture i regret the arbitrary cuts decided on by the council of ministers in spending on common agricultural policy subsidies for 2005
when the day of truth comes which it will we will have to get the treaty accepted in the remaining member states and all i can say to you is that many small projects for europe are no substitute for the great european project that is the constitution
from this rostrum i appeal urgently to the sense of humanity of the leaders of the lfec so that they free our fellow citizens some of whom have been detained for around nine months in extremely harsh living conditions
for this very reason i call upon my fellow members to vote in favour of these rigorous amendments aimed at achieving environmental protecting objectives and in doing so to take a major step towards safeguarding our environment and preventing disasters
europe is being hit by a great many disasters and their number is increasing
even when people disagreed with me they were prepared to give me a hearing
i do not believe it serves any purpose to discuss this matter now in isolation
frankly even if this aim could be achieved by the commissions financial instrument and i share mr bradbourns scepticism on this the amount of money allocated would hardly begin to dent the problem
the actual exporter shall always be responsible for notification
applause
experience from in any case denmark where dan jrgensen and i come from has taught us that if we do not create proper frameworks for green purchasing we never move beyond the talking stage

should the issue of the compulsory retirement of older people be looked into in the european union too and ought older people to be given the option of continuing in work voluntarily for longer than they are at present
the same union that proclaimed the charter of fundamental rights and which i hope will make it binding cannot be negligent in this matter
europe is making it clear today that we are not afraid to take responsibility in the area of energy and climate and that we can act as a global pioneer
that is reprehensible
the debate is closed
in kampuchea alone over 35 000 people have been injured by landmines and those are the survivors
unlike those behind this campaign the socialists are not asking any portuguese citizens to renounce their nationality but we do denounce those who attack the good reputation of portugal so as to fulfil possible commitments to silvio berlusconi
as things stood the marketing ban was meant to enter into force on 30 june 2002 and it did so

it is law that can guarantee those freedoms that europeans enjoy today
this weeks developments will make it harder than ever to relaunch the sixparty talks but in the medium to long term this framework remains the best chance for a lasting solution

these are questions which we must ask ourselves seeing as the same us congress raised the issue of whether the surveillance carried out by the nsa on us citizens was not a practice which contravened the constitution
that agricultures core activity is the production of healthy safe and highquality food is not a matter of dispute but despite that or indeed because of it we have to be able to say that there is little disagreement among farmers that in the interests of viable food production plant protection agents should be applied to cultivated plants in order to avoid the reduction of yield or quality as a result of disease pests and weeds
second we have to bring the cities of europe into the game
i cannot accept what others have been saying in terms of being satisfied with the response
parliament defended a strong position during the negotiations with the council and obtained the best possible outcome for europes citizens
nonetheless we take the view that one voice here in parliament must give a clear warning because a development is being introduced here which should give us all cause for concern
it is obvious that everyone must respect the rules laws and sovereignty of the state
my own party the european democratic party will do all it can for ratification
presidentbarroso has taken his troops in hand
mr president ladies and gentlemen let me clarify matters very briefly

during these visits i have taken the opportunity to ask several pupils from intermediate and senior secondary schools what they considered to be the main causes of the numerous road accidents
of course such imports include remunerated donations and there is no evidence at all that they are any less safe than unremunerated ones

the main change lies in the mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the dual criminality requirement is no longer in place for 32 serious crimes
mr president the commissions report makes it clear that the functioning of directive 91414eec is full of serious shortcomings
it is unacceptable for there still to be professional sectors and areas in the european union in which community legislation democratic rules and fundamental freedoms only apply to men
thank you commissioner schreyer
i am delighted that you have returned from japan safe and sound
finally we should be clear that resettlement and protected entry procedures are not an excuse for cutting back on the rights of asylumseekers arriving spontaneously in the european union member states
mr president if commissioner wallstrm will forgive me last night i dreamt of her too
we try to rectify the situation
certainly acts of cultural vandalism of the kind that appeared to have been carried out in bamiyan this week are no encouragement to the international community to engage in dialogue with this group
and my god if anglosaxons were able to come to an understanding on the echelon treaty they can exchange favours
countries that violate agreements or form a great risk must be tackled iran being a case in point
the commissions firm opinion and there i follow mr deprez arguments is that the europol convention should be replaced by a council decision pursuant to article 342c of the treaty of the european union
this directive would support local authorities and public bodies who value the environment
i believe that we need sensible concrete and totally efficient measures which will genuinely improve the environment and the quality of life
we must of course welcome the european unions decision on this question and also welcome the fact that it regularly comes up for discussion as our knowledge of the subject grows
i realise that although the eus role is modest for the time being it can nevertheless help determine the quality of democracy in future
it is also important to know that when deciding on the common agricultural policy health check we will take into account the conclusions of the european council on the financial perspective for 20072013 and the european councils appeal to the commission to carry out a comprehensive eu budget and expenditure review for 20082009
they can be enhanced and strengthened in relation to lisbon and in relation to the strengthening of european integration which means avoiding the risk of policies breaking down at national level
i hope that you will be able to look beyond the political differences and agree on this extremely important subject to support this forwardlooking initiative
clearly the rapporteur liaised closely on these with the council and on a directive of this kind that is generally the most efficient way of going about it
the european union is not a direct participant in the sixparty talks but as a responsible global player with a clear stake in preserving regional stability we have been profoundly supportive of this framework

et there are several ways to destroy media pluralism and feed biased information to the population and to prevent diversity of opinions
while supporting the position of the council i also believe that in the time left before the 2006 presidential elections it is necessary to adjust in principle eu policy on belarus to adapt it to new conditions
a coastal country must be able to take action against a ship that forms a threat
the european union has a major interest in the stability prosperity and democracy of its neighbourhood

ireland has rejected the treaty of lisbon
there is almost continuous fighting in kashmir

it is clear concise and to the point
all the member states do it cooperating with each other and with other friendly democratic countries

concerning the threshold the commissions proposal is to transfer eur 5 billion from the first to the second pillar in the period from 2009 to 2012
all who met anna lindh came to know and appreciate her exceptional qualities of warmth intelligence and openness of spirit she was the exemplary face of modern european politics

de madam president commissioners this economic recovery plan is no masterpiece above all there is not much left over for rural areas

industrial espionage is certainly not a legitimate reason for intercepting communications
we must stop regulating everything
this text should say who we are what we want and what values we espouse and defend
the placebo effect will not last long however because the real difficulty the lack of controls at the european unions internal borders remains
many people have already referred to the basic four freedoms of the eu

in a week when europe is clearly struggling to convince all its half a billion citizens of the real value of the european union this is a worthwhile initiative
i want all terrorists to be brought to book
this statement includes the following

this eu regulation will bring an end to the advertising tricks and inducements that often confuse the consumer
first of all we are looking at the emergency measures where we are proposing assistance for temporary cessation for fishing vessels and this also goes in the direction of sustainability for a maximum period of three months in addition to what is already in the european fisheries fund and not linked exclusively to biological reasons
do not propose people who go against what your commission has it in mind to do
however mr president political will is necessary but not sufficient circumstances also count and even if they are passing shortterm or temporary while they exist they affect us and place limitations on us and i welcome the fact that president sarkozy said that we need to convert circumstances into opportunities
specifically it makes it possible depending on the context to take into account the age and to consider the issue of age and disability in the insurance and banking sector if this is adequate and reasonable and i stress the words adequate and reasonable

the commission considers that family reunification is an essential element in the successful integration of third country nationals into european societies
since 2004 the commission has been providing financial assistance to a number of projects aimed at providing victims and their families with the aid and the social or psychological support they need

otherwise it can be a severe impediment to our existence
i should also like to congratulate mrs wallis who has managed to pinpoint a few sore points in her report with which i could not agree more
mr president ladies and gentlemen across the world prohibitionism has always produced two results on the one hand a large increase in the number of deaths and imprisonments among those who use narcotics who constitute the section of the prison population with the highest reoffending rate and on the other hand unlimited big business for all sorts of drug traffickers

the european pilot programmes referred to for the victims of terrorist attacks are a positive sample in terms of relieving the wounds but a great deal still needs to be done
i think the council must be able to summon up sufficient creative thought to enable us to resolve this matter so that the requirements of the law are satisfied and on 9 april we in the european parliament can give the green light to the accession treaties being signed in athens on 16 april
if we do not do that we are flying in the face of all the statements in this house not least by the rapporteurs party that we should help small businesses

mrpresident ladies and gentlemen it may well be the case that the issue we are debating also concerns my own country poland
member of the commission mr president i think these are very timely questions and this is a very important debate

on behalf of the inddem group nl madam president the theme of the kashmireu week in early june will be peace building in kashmir and it is an important initiative given the human rights violations in that region where the need for help on both sides of the border is highlighted not least by the actions of militant groups both in the indian states of jammu and kashmir and in the pakistani part azad kashmir
secondly it is justified by the eus own interest in contributing to the financial social and political stability of our neighbourhood countries as a condition for their development and democratic consolidation as this is also a prerequisite for our own political stability
of course i knew i would be able to rely on you entirely in this matter just as you can rely on me entirely
we therefore now expect a rapid proposal from the commission to get rid of these terrible additives that make cigarettes even worse
civil rights and human rights are constantly flouted and i believe that the passive attitude of the governments of european union member states does nothing to encourage things to change

i therefore appeal sincerely to the greek presidency and i am sure that it will listen to me when i ask it to do everything in its power to ensure that we find our way out of this impasse so that the athens ceremony does indeed take place and so that it is not as it were obscured by a conflict which would otherwise run the risk of calling into question either the enlargement and no one here wants that or the spirit of the interinstitutional agreements that exist between us
we must curb the adverse effects on health of risky and excessive alcohol consumption and its social and economic consequences
on the other hand i support your idea since it is also mine that huge sums must obviously be invested in development projects that for example create jobs or work i am thinking of labour intensive work which we are moreover funding

we will also need the full and active cooperation of all actors including this parliament to be able to deliver on time

pt i regret the fact that some members of this parliament are still proving unable to resist the temptation of using parliament texts in flagrant breach of the eus competences and counter to the principle of subsidiarity to encroach on the sphere reserved for member states getting involved in all sorts of issues sometimes rightly sometimes wrongly in the service of plain ideological sectarianism even in matters of the utmost political and social sensitivity
but european citizenship and good neighbourliness can only be based on respectful
during its first years of existence the euro had to face three major trials the establishment of a sound and credible central bank the creation of a stable new currency and inspiring confidence

the different procedures used to date have not in fact guaranteed either impartial methods or respect for true democracy
mr president if we want to know about the consequences and repercussions of bad and old singlehull tankers we must go to the breton or galician coast and talk to the people who live there

today we still have wars over oil in the not too distant future wars could break out over water as well

the results of this environmental damage caused by too much water in some cases and a lack of it in others will be very difficult to reverse and should remind us that the violent nature of these phenomena is the result of imbalances to which the european union has paid particular attention and will have to continue to do so
we must stimulate the widest possible debate
in order to provide legal clarity for all stakeholders and to contribute to the improvement of governance in european sport the abovementioned staff working document and its two annexes explain in depth this issue of specificity
by fair and firm i mean that we have to be fair by keeping our word sticking to the commitment that if turkey meets all the conditions of eu accession it can join the union

the length of this report makes it clear that the european union which constantly preaches respect for fundamental rights to the rest of the world is not yet free from breaches to these rights within its own borders
the commissioner has spent enough time and has had enough trouble dealing with that process

is that also correct
mr president this debate has highlighted a number of the problems which the subject we are debating raises

first of all in order to arrive at this code of conduct then in order that it should be effective

the recommendation for second reading on the council common position for adopting a directive of the european parliament and of the council on the insurance of shipowners for maritime claims 1428722008 c604832008 rapporteur gilles savary and
the council discussion points which talk of the need to tackle the social impacts of the crisis are therefore extremely important in my opinion

mr president ladies and gentlemen the fight to have europes christian roots written into the prologue of the european constitution will have brought into conflict throughout the convention and the intergovernmental conference the most hardened proponents of secularism headed by mrmichel and mr chirac on the one side and certain countries such as poland italy or portugal supported by no less prestigious a figure than pope johnpaul ii on the other
i should also like to say how pleased i am with the eur 300 million that we have managed to find in order to respond in the short term to the very serious crisis affecting farmers today i hope that this sum of money and these difficulties will mean that we take a pragmatic approach with regard to their future
links between terrorists in different countries now form part of the fretwork of internationally organised crime
in the west bank the building of the wall of shame represents serious infringement of the palestinian peoples right to move freely and right to land it poses a threat to human rights and to peace
the most surprising and shocking thing for me in the genoa events was therefore to actually see how within the forces of law and order something tiny a mere change of government a defamatory campaign by the antig8 movement inadequate organisation and a bunch of violent hooligans was enough to bring out in some of them i stress some of them a desire to become the instruments of blind and profoundly stupid intimidation
mr president commissioner road freight transport in europe has increased enormously over recent decades and will increase by more than 60 by 2013

mrs frassoni on behalf of the council i would like to welcome your report on the commissions annual report on monitoring the application of community law and the additional analysis envisaged in the commissions communication a europe of results applying community law

natural disasters can affect any country in the world
i would also like to briefly mention the importance of the un presence in iraq which as i indicated certainly with a view to the elections is considerable
that is something we have to prevent
mr president we cannot remain aloof
you spoke of energyefficient homes two years have elapsed and hungary has not introduced the directive on the energy certification of buildings
however i do not share this opinion at all
in britain we are told that this is a small price to pay for the privilege of trading with our neighbours and for the prosperity the eu has brought us
if they stick to them we will be able to achieve 26 by 2010 which is an improvement but and i have to make this clear it is not enough and so the commission will continue to bring pressure to bear on them
applause

i am also calling for a register of buyers sellers and traders of mercury to allow regular monitoring of movements of imports and exports
in fact like many of my fellow members i consider that the european employment strategy we have known over the past five years has to varying degrees perhaps depending on the regions been effective and has benefited the citizens of europe
the next item is the commissions statement on the situation in taiwan following the recent typhoon
the fact that great britain not only had the generosity but also the sense to open its labour market immediately to people from eastern europe means that now apart from germany and austria which mrbrok appears to have forgotten many other european countries have followed in britains footsteps

a lot of work remains to be done and we are painfully aware of the problems that exist corruption organised crime the difficulties of integrating the roma and the situation of orphans
we must also consider the subject of globalisation as the commissioner has mentioned i think it is incumbent upon the united states and europe to ensure that the outcome of these discussions proves positive rather than negative
this is why i wanted to link the very finest of sport and what sportsmen and women do to get to the condition they are in while also encouraging those at lesser levels of sport to understand that taking a quick drink is not going to make you the best sportsperson in the world
es madam president i would like to express my support and acknowledgement of the work that some of our fellow members have been doing for a long time with regard to ethiopia and in particular that of our friend and colleague ana gomes not just because of the mission that took place but because over all these years she has been condemning the situation in ethiopia and taking it extremely seriously
mr president as the shadow rapporteur on the legal affairs committee working with my colleague mrs berger i would like to thank our colleagues on the economic and monetary affairs committee for accepting so many amendments from our committee

my question to the commission is whether it is prepared to do that
we have clearly defined provisions governing secrecy etc
in the course of a budget procedure the european parliament being an assembly of politically thinking heads engages in a certain number of internal debates but when it came to the subject of agencies there were no differences between the various groups we agreed that cooperation with the agencies had been improved over the last three years although that does not mean that the good cannot be made better
the producers themselves are all for this
and i would ask myself commissioner whether in these circumstances with a country which does not wish to have a link with the european union because it has rejected incorporation into the cotonou agreement for a second time with a country whose leaders reject community aid with a country whose leaders insult and denigrate european union heads of government with a country which imposes endless restrictions on the presentation of identity cards by the commissions diplomatic representative it is worth commissioner keeping the office in havana open

an euchina agreement on coordinated controls of trade in drug precursors is expected to be signed at the upcoming euchina summit that will allow us to combat trade in illicit drugs more effectively

pt following on from the question by my colleague robert evans i should like to ask the council about its readiness to strengthen the rights of passengers with reduced mobility in the maritime sector

it is prohibition which kills users by denying them the information they need about the drugs they put into their bodies

undoubtedly the budget for 2007 that is to say the first year of a new programming period is of strategic significance

however i regret one omission which i feel could be prejudicial to consumer protection
i have just come from a discussion on the socalled economic recovery plan and i would like to say that what is happening here with the constant search for margins which are no longer available and with new plans which infringe on the budgetary rights of parliament makes it clear that we cannot go on as before
the lower the price the more it is used and vice versa
investment in people is one of the three objectives of the cohesion policy and i think that point should come out in the debate
i believe that your debate shows us clearly that we absolutely must not relax our efforts on the contrary we must concentrate all of our means all of our abilities of cooperation on that most symbolic of european projects the european space policy
it is already there and we need to be a lot more progressive
currently only six countries are involved in it and that is not enough
cuts need to be made during the crisis
the report did however contain other albeit less serious examples of attempts to use and abuse a subject of such relevance and interest to all citizens social security systems in order to impose visions that lack consensus and challenge the distribution of powers and competences within the eu
peace and progress in the region
our objective should therefore be the smallest risk which does not mean the smallest quantity
the vote will take place today
i am grateful to mrs frassoni for again raising the subject of cyprus which gives me the chance to tell your house something more about it
the first guideline concerns the procedures and principles for improving cooperation and conduct in international financial crises
firstly i believe that member states involved in echelon must disengage from this murky undemocratic system the report does not make this clear

the clear aim of these reforms was to improve the competitiveness of the european fund industry to enable it to reduce its costs to develop and make use of economies of scale to ensure that all fund providers do indeed have access to all markets in the european union and to achieve all of this without reducing protection for investors on the contrary we wanted to improve protection for investors
the truth is that the report was presented last year but it was in its own words inadequate and we are waiting for the final report which means that now six months from the end of the term established for integration we do not have a report or any initiatives from the commission
it is an important step and it should be supported by many people precisely in this difficult period in which the eu finds itself
as well as my fellow meps i should like to thank the various nongovernmental organisations ngos that played a constructive role as pressure groups right through the process and that now also expressly support the compromise
it is a challenge which can and must be met in the forthcoming midterm review
in any case any possible future support could only be envisaged if coupled with reconversion
in the oldfashioned culture of paternalistic power and the topdown approach openness can wait
the second question i would like to refer to is that europe is unable to define its own identity
these conclusions are hardly surprising but they are not very helpful as a stepbystep solution to the backlog of problems in the european union

es mr president animal welfare which has been included in the cap since the last reform is already an achievement for european agriculture though according to the results of the special eurobarometer carried out in 2005 on this issue europeans are unaware of the efforts being made by our producers and do not therefore appreciate them despite the fact that we have the most protective legislation
let me note that it does not make much difference whether we talk about partnerships or deals
we raised two other issues the involvement of ceiops and the state of affairs regarding the prudential rules as well as possible additional quantitative rules added by member states but i will not go into details on those

the debate is closed
the consequences are negative for volunteer work since there are insufficient actions of support from the state even if it can represent a considerable part of a countrys economy

as far as the following stage is concerned which is the implementation of article 96 of cotonou which we call consultation and adoption of appropriate measures again in conventional language the council will look at this issue at the beginning of october with of course our participation and we will decide then whether or not we will take this step

we attach great importance to croatias ability to solve pending questions with its neighbours including border disputes as soon as possible
i feel that there is a lack of will in parliament to tackle the entirely unacceptable economic management that we are witnessing in respect of large parts of the eus funds
recently there has been much talk about the nopayment principle in particular
we have placed additional emphasis on the field of foreign affairs which i think is a positive move
at the meeting held on 4 june the ministers the presidents of the european central bank and the commissioner responsible considered the preparations being made for the introduction of euro notes and coins on 1 january 2002
therefore i believe that is a step backwards
i am convinced that the majority of wellinformed enlightened consumers would never buy a product that had suffered agonising torment before ending up on the shelves
this will nevertheless require considerable effort on the part of the union

in the absence of any impact assessment on the part of either the council or the commission we caused evaluations to be carried out and these confirm not only that there will be massive distortion of competition and illegal discrimination against the farmers concerned but also that modulation does nothing to serve the objects of the community in rural areas but rather jeopardises them to a considerable degree
each country has its own rules and i am not going to tell the countries what they have to do on this issue

vicepresident of the commission in my area of responsibility for budget discharge i will soon appear before parliament and the committee on budgetary control to explain what should be done to protect and to ensure the proper use of european money these are very large topics
this is because were we to agree to this request it would amount to signing a blank document regarding this agreement at a time when the discussions within our committee are far from complete as shown by the liveliness of yesterdays debates and at a time when the committee on development which has a particular interest in this type of agreement has not yet issued its opinion
as i stressed earlier the firstreading agreement on the proposal in the area of applicable law has an impact on the other proposal in the area of family law given that the two texts are largely identical

mr president commissioners researchers into time found out this past week that the second half of life passes much more quickly than the first and that which is true of life is also of course true of the lifetimes of legislatures so since your commission has not much time left it should be all the more ambitious in its approach to doing its work

this gesture of solidarity from the rest of europe will be most welcome in my constituency

the commission wants to help the developing countries to take advantage of trade

b505752001 by mrs maes and mrs mckenna on behalf of the group of the greenseuropean free alliance
what remains to be done then
i should like to conclude by saying one more thing that quite rightly there is a clear majority in this parliament for dispensing with the references to repeated minor infringements
they are neither
perhaps i might add that if you want to make yourself less dependent on oil and gas imports in order to have motor vehicles emitting less in the way of co2 you will hardly be able to offer nuclear power as an alternative unless we in europe can agree to drive only electric cars
terrorism on the other hand does not follow the rules of official war does not only involve the military and does not operate on the battlefield
